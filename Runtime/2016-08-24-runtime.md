## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.21.1, fixing community reported bugs including a regression around ansi coloring in `cf logs` on Windows, and digitally signing the Windows binaries.
- Created a Debian package repository to allow users to install and update their cf CLI using `apt-get`. Investigating RPM.
- Kept refactoring on a branch while waiting for updates to a PR with translations, planning to merge soon.
- Identified a number of complications with maintain translations with the Goflags library introduced to replace the home-built command parsing logic. Taking into account the burden on the team of internationalization, a lack of other common CLI tools with built-in translations to use for reference, and low stats for non-English downloaders (judging from Accept-Language HTTP header), we wrote [a proposal to limit translations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dMDPgDt-9YVScTRLUC_AnOmnFkV8zoAjqujsrsVKlOc/edit?ts=57b5f340#) to cover only the help pages, i.e. leave error and status messages in English. Asking input from IBM.
- Exploring some tweaks to the new [proposed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YasoPyhuajxcecV0QuFAtvnscR0ZZ1_vterDVXY8qDM/edit?usp=sharing) `cf help` output.
- Considering to remove the loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)) soon after releasing the new help.
