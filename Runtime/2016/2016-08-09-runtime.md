## Cross cutting initiatives
- Elastic Clusters -> How about renaming it back to Placement Pools
-- Agreed to combine initiatives for a more iterative approach with matching milestones

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.21.0, adding support for defining TCP routes and HTTP routes with paths in app manifests and updated message translations.
- Close to releasing cf CLI 6.21.1, fixing community reported bugs including a regression around ansi coloring in `cf logs` on Windows, and digitally signing the Windows binaries.
- Completed (on a branch) internal golang imports change to `code.cloudfoundry.org/cli`.
- Started (on a branch) refactoring towards the implementation of the [`cf help` redesign](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YasoPyhuajxcecV0QuFAtvnscR0ZZ1_vterDVXY8qDM/edit?usp=sharing).
- Considering to remove the loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)) soon after releasing the new help.
- Progressing well on investigation of software repo management options to enable users to download and update the cf CLI using apt-get.

### Garden

#### Grootfs - Will Pragnell

- Shipped v0.1.0 with basic creation/deletion of filesystems from a disk based rootfs
- Now working on pulling docker images from remote registries and applying disk quotas to filesystems

#### Garden Core - Julz Friedman

- Released v0.341.0 of garden-linux with some fixes to allow garden-linux to work with 4.4 stemcells
- Released v0.4.0 of garden-runc with major improvements including
   - Security: enable AppArmor protection for unprivileged containers (this is a big deal!)
   - Integration: use "Create/start" split to enable better integration of container-to-container networker
   - Integration: allow exit code to be retrieved from processes after garden restart (important for concourse)
   - Operability: remove iodaemon! (big source of support headaches now gone)
- Tracked down flakiness in inigo tests
- Investigation around iodaemon issues in garden-linux on some environments
- Begun exploration of next main focus of work, 'rootless garden-runc', hope to be able to fully remove the need for `root` to run garden-runc.

### Greenhouse - David Morhovich
 - [revert magical CUPS behavior](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/126315093) 
 - [write temp files in container directory](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1156164/stories/122149771)

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Deployed 20-cell cluster in "Flintstone" environment, running BBS API-based tests against it
- Working on new tooling in diego-perf-release to push CF apps for later tests
- Various logging and metrics improvements to support analysis of experiments
- Continuing work on story to have cell download cache persist across restarts
- Added manifest-generation script for windows-cell BOSH deployment
- Continuing basic development of `cfdot`: added usage messages, adding TLS-config flags
- Added opt-in mechanism to derive cell AZ assignment from Azure fault domain


### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Routing components, including gorouter, upgraded to golang 1.6. Final release of routing-release forthcoming
- Picked up performance track again as team strength allows

### Infrastructure - Amit Gupta
* Finished extracting postgres-release and building out pipeline.
* Wrapping up etcd TLS zero-downtime upgrade tests
* Working on parallelizing and speeding up consul-release and etcd-release pipelines
* Working on `bbl` supporting upcoming BOSH CLI
* Working on `bbl` supporting tagging resources for better identifiability

### Release Integration - Amit Gupta
* CATS-as-a-Concourse task validates input
* nats-release pipeline now fully testing along with rest of CF and cutting final releases
* BOSH-2.0 CF manifest now gets all bits from bosh.io, and only buildpacks still come from cf-release
* nats-release already receiving helpful PRs
* starting work on streamlining CATS for better parallelizability and consistency
* pipeline cleanup and refactoring

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel
- Fixed a memory leak when downloads fail during staging
- Evacuation waits for staging to complete.
- Send a 503 (Service Unavailable) when attempting to stage during evacuation.
  (Waiting on CAPI bump to cause a retry)
- Inactivity timeouts set to 30s instead of 300s.

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell
- Support for dynamic IPs
- Building load test infrastructure to test Metron->Doppler TCP upgrade
 - Using Concourse, starting from a stub, build up AWS deployment, run load test, run a deployment, tear down environment 
 - Generally useful for CF?
- testing very large log messages (100Mb)
- Metron Windows now in our CI pipeline

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Nicholas Calugar
- V3 migration is nearly code complete, upcoming stories are mostly verification
- Publishing capi-release on bosh.io
- Merged BITS service PR as experimental, disabled by default
- CC supports new `cloud_controller.admin_read_only` for all GET endpoints
- User specified buildpack is encrypted at rest, creds in buildpack url masked for GET requests

### PERSI - Ted Young
- Completed v2.10 of Volume Services (https://bit.ly/cf-volume-services)
- Awaiting feedback for Docker pull request (https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/24938)
- Started EFS reference Driver/Broker for AWS
- Investigating Snapshot/Restore 
- Refactoring Cell API to enable scheduling experiments (https://bit.ly/cell-api-proposal)

### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran
- Began effort to consolidate network interfaces inside of application containers -- goal is to only have eth0 and loopback.  eth0 will be on the container network, able to receive port-forwarded traffic from the gorouter, and able to reach the internet via on-cell masquerade.  This is a large effort and is still in flight.

- Improved system component logging: now forwarding to syslog, consolidating per-container CNI logs in one place, added iptables logging for packet drops

### Bits-Service - Simon Moser

- Bits-Service successfully merged & integrated in the CAPI release
- Mainly working on leftover chores from that, e.g. adjusting the pipelines & tests
