## PMC Lifecycle Activities
Will Pragnell - Garden teams currently at 4 pairs and looking at splitting it into 2 smaller teams so that they can grow more.
Split out component that's responsible for managing file system layers from the rest of Garden.
Proposing to split the Garden team into two, with a proposal for Julz Friedman to be one of the garden PMs.
Expectation to do this after current security epic completes.
No objections on the call. Dieu to follow up with an email to Runtime PMC members.
