## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Merged our refactoring branch into master, currently resolving inconsistencies in output of some commands.
- Completing the last story on [improving the UX](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YasoPyhuajxcecV0QuFAtvnscR0ZZ1_vterDVXY8qDM/edit?usp=sharing) of the main help page, added "see also" sections to individual help pages.
- Validating assumptions with IBM (who have been updating the translations of CLI messages) about the requirement and scope of localisation in the cf CLI: While maintaining the translated help pages, is there room for discontinuing the localisation of error messages? This came out of a realisation during the refactor work that quite an amount of engineering effort goes into maintaining internationalization support. Note that we won't make any changes without consulting the CF community.
- The next release will be after the discussion above is resolved and a number of (minor) help page improvements have been implemented.
- Looking into changing the Windows installer to allow users to install the cf CLI without requiring administrator access.
- Signing the RPMs with a Cloud Foundry Foundation certificate.
- Preparing to host an RPM package repository to allow users to install and update their cf CLI using `yum`.
- Considering to remove the loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)) soon after releasing the new help.
- Exploring how to expose V3 tasks through the cf CLI, as well as container to container networking related workflows, and long-lived uaa tokens.

### Garden

#### GrootFS - Will Pragnell

- _Still_ very close to shipping v0.2.0 with support for Docker images (held up by a fiddly bug)
- Disk quotas now also very close to being completed
- Up next, more work to actually integrate with Garden-runC

#### Garden Core - Julz Friedman

 - Garden-runc 100% of PWS!! Thinking of cutting a 1.0 release and recommending everyone migrate soon.. (at which point we will discuss a timetable to end-of-life garden-linux)
 - Now that garden-runc is in production, with AppArmor and seccomp, it is significantly safer to turn on docker support in multi-tenant environments...
 - Released 0.7.0 to fix a window size bug encountered by concourse and to ensure aufs module is loaded even when graph driver is disabled
 - Released 0.8.0 to fix PATH environment-variable bug
 - Our CI cannot yet produce patch releases
 - Lots of investigation in to performance on Softlayer
 - Focus now turning back to garden-runc-runs-as-non-root-user work

### Greenhouse - David Morhovich

- Nothing new to report with respect to Greenhouse.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Initial round of development done on app-pusher and app-monitoring tools
- Running 5000-instance tests on AWS and GCP environments
- Started work on Cell and LRP/Task placement tags to support isolation segments
- Cells that have reached their evacuation timeout shut down containers gracefully
- Updated diego-release to use Golang 1.7
- Added more ActualLRP commands to `cfdot`


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Infrastructure - Amit Gupta

#### `consul-release`
- Sped up `consul-release` CI
- Changed how we orchestrate Consul so that `consul-release` clusters can recover from quorum loss
- Started putting `dnsmasq` daemon into `consul_agent` job by default to deal with timeout and payload size issues in Consul DNS.

#### `etcd-release`
- Sped up `etcd-release` CI
- Miscellaneous cleanup on `etcd-release`, e.g. removing `/varz` support

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)
- Increased max threads for `bbl`-provisioned BOSH Director, and reserved a thread for debugging tasks like `bosh ssh`
- `bbl` tags and names resources it creates for better identifiability
- Spiked on `terraform` and how `bbl` could support Google Cloud Platform

### Release Integration - Amit Gupta

####  `cf-release`
- Cut v241

#### `cf-deployment`
- Manifest is now publicly available (still beta), and supports interpolating values using new `bosh` CLI
- Removed some `nats` configuration from manifest due to links work finishing in `nats-release`

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`

- Major refactors to `cf-test-helpers`
- All control of which tests to run now managed through CONFIG
- Spiked on moving all tests to one suite (but still multiple packages and directories), cut runtime in half!

#### `cf-smoke-tests`

- No changes

#### `nats-release`

- Finished building out full pipeline for `nats-release` smoke tests standalone NATS cluster, and then integrates with CF deployment and runs CATS
- Pipeline tests compabitibility with 1.0- and 2.0-style BOSH deployments through entire pipeline, including testing against new `cf-deployment` manifest
- Finished "linkifying" `nats` job so that `nats.machines` and `nats.port` no longer need to be specified in `nats` job -- NATS clients will need to start consuming these links to remove these things from the manifest entirely.

### postgres-release - Amit Gupta

#### `postgres-release`

- No changes (only one engineer, on vacation)

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel
- Spaces can be associated with an isolation segment
- Org work underway

### Loggregator - Allen Duet
- Research on improving throughput of messages
- Upgrading LATS for TCP?TLS support & LATS fixes
- addresing service discovery issues - evaluating moving to consul from etcd
- Working on tags in dropsonde metrics

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Nicholas Calugar

### PERSI - Ted Young
- commited v2.10 Volume Service API
- Shared Volumes now considered GA
- Working on Amazon EFS broker and driver

### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran
- Single interface c2c code is now in garden development branch. Thanks to the garden team for merging our PR
- Working on setting up a scalabilty testbed, will continue to flesh out scalability and stabilty tests

### Bits-Service - Simon Moser

- Bits-service pipeline was hit by the port change from CC WebDAV client - main activity in the last days was to get the pipeline back to green.
- Team was at most 1 person in the last weeks, therefore very slow progress.
