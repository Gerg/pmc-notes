## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario
- Inception scheduled for 11/11.
- Recently performed a user study with an experienced CF user who wanted to set up .NET support. Got GREAT feedback.
    - If anyone else is interested in being part of a user study, please reach out!
- Investing in updating and clarifying documentation with some current exploration stories.
- Finding more real-world bugs as users begin to install in production environments and report them. (eg. containerizer user must have local-logon privs)
- Created a new standalone application, [Hakim](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/hakim) for debugging purposes.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Performance:
	- Breadth:
		- 100-cell test concluded, scheduling and bulk-loops performed well
		- investigating issues with etcd dropping writes during benchmark-test seeding
	- Depth:
		- seeing issues with overloaded cells during staging
		- btrfs quota groups seem to exacerbate CPU contention, disk I/O degradation
		- getting aufs builds from garden, stressing out with lots of container churn, disk IO

- Docker:
	- can now stage (only) from v2 Docker registries

- Placement:
	- auction distributes tasks much more evenly across cells
	- auction times out failed state requests more aggressively by default
	- more logging around auction activity

- Upgrade testing:
	- developing automated test suite to verify downtimeless upgrades from 0.1434.0 to HEAD


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Mega - Amit Gupta
- Not much external-facing progress on main tracks
- Lots of internal refactoring of our tooling
- Numerous GitHub issues, PRs, and mailing list queries

### LAMD - Jim Campbell

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### Lattice - David Wadden

### CAPI - Dieu Cao
