## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario
- Inception scheduled for 11/11.
- Recently performed a user study with an experienced CF user who wanted to set up .NET support. Got GREAT feedback.
    - If anyone else is interested in being part of a user study, please reach out!
- Investing in updating and clarifying documentation with some current exploration stories.
- Finding more real-world bugs as users begin to install in production environments and report them. (eg. containerizer user must have local-logon privs)
- Created a new standalone application, [Hakim](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/hakim) for debugging purposes.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Performance:
	- Breadth:
		- 100-cell test concluded, scheduling and bulk-loops performed well
		- investigating issues with etcd dropping writes during benchmark-test seeding
	- Depth:
		- seeing issues with overloaded cells during staging
		- btrfs quota groups seem to exacerbate CPU contention, disk I/O degradation
		- getting aufs builds from garden, stressing out with lots of container churn, disk IO

- Docker:
	- can now stage (only) from v2 Docker registries

- Placement:
	- auction distributes tasks much more evenly across cells
	- auction times out failed state requests more aggressively by default
	- more logging around auction activity

- Upgrade testing:
	- developing automated test suite to verify downtimeless upgrades from 0.1434.0 to HEAD


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Mega - Amit Gupta
- Not much external-facing progress on main tracks
- Lots of internal refactoring of our tooling
- Numerous GitHub issues, PRs, and mailing list queries

### LAMD - Jim Campbell

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### Lattice - David Wadden

- Exploring how to bring the developer experience on Lattice more in-line with the CF developer experience
  - Spiking on adding UAA/CC and measuring footprint increase on single node
- Reviewing download metrics / survey results to better understand Lattice use cases + configurations
  - Will inform prioritization of (re-)adding support for DigitalOcean, GCE, other platforms
- Lattice [v0.6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice-release/releases/tag/v0.6.0) (Diego 0.1434.0) released
  - Built with packer-bosh instead of hand-rolled Upstart scripts
  - "temporarily discontinued" platform(s) being reviewed for prioritization 
  - `USER` directives are honored from docker images (can also specify manually)
  - `ltc` can define HTTP routes to fully-qualified domains and context paths [#104](cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice#104) [#217](cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice#217)
- Windows support being added for Lattice "as a user"
  - `vagrant up` / `terraform apply` brings up Linux cluster from Windows
  - Supports ltc running on Windows

### CAPI - Dieu Cao
