  - uploading of droplets
  - updating port ranges of router groups.
  - removing of loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)).

### Garden - Julz Friedman

### GrootFS - Will Pragnell / George Lestaris

- Discovered a permissions issue using the cflinuxfs2 rootfs when trying to run CATs using GrootFS - currently investigating two potential solutions
- Continuing to improve Garden-runC integration by simplifying the image plugin API
- Performance investigation work essentially paused while we focus on the above

### Greenhouse - David Morhovich

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Diego v1.2.0 and later require a relational store for the BBS
- Added configuration to secure auctioneer API server with mutual TLS
- Removed support for experimental "caching" Docker staging flow in anticipation of better mechanism to run Docker images requiring repository authentication
- Started track to run route-emitters locally on the cells, removing the need for a route-emitter lock
- Added `CF_INSTANCE_INTERNAL_IP` env var for container networking
- Updated to Golang v1.7.4


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Infrastructure - Adrian Zankich

#### `consul-release`

### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`

#### `cf-deployment`

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`

#### `cf-smoke-tests`

### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

#### `postgres-release`
- Improved PostgreSQL version upgrade procedure to consume less disk space. As an effect of this change the PostgreSQL data directory has been moved from `/var/vcap/store/postgres-9.4.9` to `/var/vcap/store/postgres/postgres-9.4.9`. Pre-start now checks that postgres is actually stopped (for no more than 30 secs) to avoid collision while moving the directory.
- Reduced postgres monit start timeout. The timeout has been exposed as an optional property and it defaults to monit global default.

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel
- No updates

### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor
- Implemented pooling between Metrons & Dopplers (using gRPC)
- Added encryption between Metrons  & Dopplers (using gRPC)
- Improved service discovery to use DNS
- Identified key track of work for separating out syslog from doppler

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Nicholas Calugar
- Effort to remove stateless cc-bridge components and do Mutual TLS between CC and Diego is going well
- Space scoped staging security groups

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj

### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran

### Bits-Service - Simon Moser
