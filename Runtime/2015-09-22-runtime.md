## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

- Question from Dave: Will this be aggressively cleaning up docker image layers

### Greenhouse - Kim Johnson

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Question from Amit: Is the plan to go 10, 20, 100?
- Eric: 10 to start then jump to 100 then more targeted tests
- Receptor is in process of being removed from diego-release
- Chip: What's tracker say for 0.9?
- Eric: You can see the release marker on tracker

### Routing - Shannon Coen
- wrapped up several weeks of perf investigation, cost in terms of latency for enabling ssl for gorouter
-- the initial request with ssl handshake is 3x slower, if edge load balancer doesn't have keep-alive, impact felt every time, otherwise, subsequent requests were similar
-- investigated perfect forward secrecy, marginal cost
-- will summarize results and share soon
-- considering a non PFS cipher by default
-- looked at improving performance by enabling keep-alive from gorouter to containers. saw about 15% perf improvement with keep alive in that segment.
- continued working on cc work for exposing route services
- large amount of additional backlog for cc for tcp and multiple ports left, plan to talk to capi later this week on how to do more
- combining the http and tcp routing apis
-- plan to eventually move the combined component into a routing release and submodule it into cf-release
-- includes some backwards incompatible changes for the routing api, solicited feedback from community if anyone is currently using the routing-api

- Sykes: for load balancers that don't support keep-alive any investigation into abbreviated handshakes/SID caching?
- Shannon: no, does it require shared caching?
- Sykes: it does
- Sykes: there's an issue with running out of local port side on gorouter, can use ip aliasing, Shannon to follow up offline.

### Mega - Amit Gupta
- extracted general purpose route registration job that can be used by each component
-- currently has basic functionality, solicity feedback from community about what else is out there
-- should help to smooth transition from nats based routing registration to routing api
- worked on updating canaries into ci
-- exploring existing canaries, plan to improve them
- improving documenation for bosh-lite work flow
-- ensuring there's a single source of truth and tooling for working with cf on bosh-lite
-- should just work with diego too
- changes in bosh so that bosh manifest can support urls, local file paths for tarballs, stemcells similar to bosh-init
-- allows a user to just have a manifest so that a user does not have to explicitly create/upload a release
-- should no-op if release already present
-- working on dev and ops experience being nice
- lots of PRs, issues, community, pipeline work
- coming up, lots of existing mega tooling and working on improving that based on user feedback
- exploring aws expenditures, looking at recommending cheaper instance types
- after bosh work complete, will redo tooling for how we deploy cf as a composite deployment
- Identity team is nearly ready to extract out of cf-release and part of the new tooling

### LAMD - Erik Jasiak
- a little thin right now on the team
- Fraenkel will be joining the team on Friday
- additional dojo participant will arrive on Oct 3rd
- push for collector deprecation
-- identifying metrics that are missing, etcd release and routing api
-- some diego metrics renamed
- push for documentation, focus on nozzle and firehose
- question about how/where to document metrics from the various components
- using the route registration job
- going forward with the point proposal to add a point type to the dropsonde protocol
-- tcp vs udp questions, would like more feedback
- firehose cli plugin will be pulled in

- Amit: discovered some of the UAA varz metrics weren't making it out to collector
- Erik: will follow up with Sree
- Sree: working on getting the statsd stuff, hopefully available in the next release, will look into the varz issue

### UAA - Sree Tummidi
- UAA Release 2.6.2 out. Authorize endpoint now supports token based authentication in addition to the regular web based authentication flow. This is used for authenticating third party SSH clients to CloudFoundry.
- UAA SAML Integration proposal out. No review comments from the community yet. We will proceed with the integration as planned.
- Work underway for UAA release 2.7.0. Highlights of this release include disabling of internal user management and authenitcation (In Web & API layer) when external user store is selected. 
- LDAP/SAML Invitations API and Identity Provider discovery work underway. 

- Deepak: question from huawei about role based access control
- Sree: looking at policy where if you are in a certain group, you'll get certain access on the cloud foundry side
 
### Lattice - David Wadden
- working on ssh, about half done
- lots of bug fixes and performance that came out of spring one
- bringing in proxy support
- will move on to working on private docker registry
- looking at how to keep in sync with Diego, packer-bosh at build time

### CAPI - Dieu Cao
- Blog post created on Cloud Foundry Foundation blog about Billing Events
- Continued cross team pairing with routing on Route Services
- Completed the long running story for staging v3 apps on Diego
- Investigated documentation alternatives for apidocs, plan to spike on a couple options
- Completed adding endpoint for purging a single service instance and its bindings and keys, available in cf-release 218
- Good progress on v3 consistency stories
- Added back the end points for allowing org managers and space managers to add users by username along with feature flags, available in cf-release 218, needs some documentation clean up.
- Worked on preserving file modes during upload
- Worked on changing the buildpack lifecycle on Diego to return all process types in the staging response 
- Considering changing some of the v3 end points to better represent the different lifecycles [here](https://github.com/zrob/v3-lifecycles)
