### Mega - Amit Gupta
* Extracted `consul-release` from `cf-release`.
* Working on beefy tests for `consul-release`, very similar to what we did for `etcd-release`.
* Refined some of our AWS, BOSH, and Concourse bootstrap tooling.  In particular, it can now generate many credentials for you, simplifying the bootstrap experience for the new user.
* Finished improvements to docs for CF on BOSH-Lite, [docs.cloudfoundry.org](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org) is now the single source of truth.
* Nearly ready to deliver several stories about specifying URLs, local tarball paths, and local directory paths for releases and stemcells in BOSH deployment manifest, so you can just `bosh deploy` without creating, downloading, and uploading releases and stemcells.  Remaining work is just to optimize so that it skips doing the work for assets that the BOSH Director already has.
* New integration pipeline is recording blessed tuples of `cf-release` SHA, `etcd-release` final version, and AWS stemcell type and version.
* Bumped all the things to Golang 1.4 to address 1.3 CVE.
* Ongoing: community and pipelines.
