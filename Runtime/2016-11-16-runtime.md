## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Prettified the [CLI repo readme](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/blob/master/README.md) with CFF logo and ToC.
  Please take a look & copy & paste to yours what you like!  
  (Molten logo made available by CFF in a GH repo for this usage)
- Nearing completion of one-off task related commands. CAPI is evaluating the edge builds and providing feedback.  
 In the meantime we're adding long-lived uaa tokens, creation of external users and updating of port ranges of router groups before we release.
- Progressing well on exposing staged application artefacts ("droplets") upload UX.
- Planning to remove the loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)) in the release after the next one.
