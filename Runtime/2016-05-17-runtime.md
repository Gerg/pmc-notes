## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

#### Garden-runC (OCS/runC)

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

- Exploration around some security limitations for containers, including a few fixes / updates. Nothing major here, no worries.
- Currently working on fixing an issue with X.509 certificates in Windows containers
- Team strength has been significantly down due to travel and vacation

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Working on automatic migration of BBS data from etcd to a relational store
- Worked with Core Services to operate MySQL proxy jobs in consul-locked mode
- Improving docs for operating Diego with an RDS or CF-MySQL store
- Continuing integration with garden-runc, will soon block Diego pipeline on it and record compatible versions
- Investigated Diego behavior in consul failure modes, generated stories to improve resiliency
- Fixed a vulnerability regarding log-stream parsing; if on 0.1468.0 through 0.1470.0, please upgrade to 0.1471.0 or later
- Finished transfer of CC-Bridge jobs to capi-release
- Removed rootfses job from diego-release
- Import-path service fully functional; will make sure is ready for production, then start migrating Diego repos to a code.cloudfoundry.org import path


### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Gorouter access logs can be streamed to syslog without performance penalty
- Fixed bug reported by Fraenkel, where Gorouter would not retry requests with non-zero bodies
- TCP Routing announced
- Audit events for Route-Service bind/unbind
- Security enhancement: tcp-emitter and router-configurer no longer run as root
- Adding quotas for reserved route ports (TCP routes)
- Adding mitigations for stale routes to both TCP and HTTP route registration flows
- Gorouter moved to routing-release, symlinked into cf-release
- route-registrar now supports route_service_url, enabling system components (or brokers) to use route-services

### Infrastructure - Amit Gupta
- Fixed issues related to etcd and consul interactions causing problems with Diego database multi-node clusters.
- Removed `consul-common` package from `consul-release`, and improved process management in `confab`.
- Remove ruby logic in consul startup scripts, replaced with BOSH-native `spec.address`.
- Re-working `bbl` UX around managing load balancers to be more CRUD-y.
- Bumping consul to 0.6.4 in preparation for WAN support in service of Elastic Clusters.

### Release Integration - Amit Gupta
- Extracted `nats` and `nats_stream_forwarder` jobs from `cf-release` into `nats-release`.
- Various pipeline refactors, e.g. cleaning up Docker images used by our Concourse, separating deploy and test jobs, separating private credentials repos.
- Testing Diego much more heavily in main release integration pipelines.
- Extracting CATS as a reusable Concourse task, lighter-weight than errand.

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell
- Auditing metrics documentation, assisting all teams in getting it current
- Added a number of metrics
- Testing rolling upgrades under load for Metron->Dopper UDP to TCP, and TCP to TLS
- Deep into adding tags to metrics
- A number of NOAA tweaks - recommended to upgrade to latest

### CAPI - Nicholas Calugar
- CC-Bridge properties must be sourced from `properties.capi` namespace for upcoming CF-238
- Fixed bug where Sequel would log all queries because we were setting the log level for queries to be the CC log level
- `properties.domain` has been deprecated in favor of `properties.system_domain`
- WebDAV blobstore now has configurable list of allowed networks for those with non-standard private networks
- WebDAV blobstore now sets number of worker processes to number of CPU cores
- CC supports a configurable list of system hostnames (api, hm9000, loggregator) that disallow creating of routes on the system_domain
- V3
  - Inception for backing V2 and V3 with same underlying data on Thursday, May 19 2016
  - Improved consistency across filters for V3 resources
  - Increased column width of command / environment variables for V3 tasks
  - Pagination includes total_pages

### PERSI - Ted Young

### Container Networking - Evan Farrar
