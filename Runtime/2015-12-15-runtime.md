## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Shipped v0.330.0, which improved security around streaming in and out of containers

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Lots of progress. Heading towards an MMVP line which will allow us to deploy with Diego and begin testing performance and integration. Hoping to hit this very early in 2016.
  - No docker image support yet
  - No resource limits yet
- Working with the container-to-container networking team to figure out how they'll integrate with Guardian. Going well.

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Bind-mounting buildpack downloads: BBS/executor story in flight
- Improving reliability of etcd interactions in BBS benchmarks; already fixed one problem that caused creates to flake
- Auctioneer retries state queries with exponential backoff
- Refactored executor internals to ensure fast state responses
- Upgrade-from-stable test suite complete, working on running reliably in CI
- Reproducing slow evacuation times to validate some proposed changes (native port health-check, accounting for scheduled starts in the auction)


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### MEGA - Amit Gupta

#### Infrastructure (Consul, etcd, NATS, Postgres, environment bootstrapping)

 * Finished re-write of Consul start-up scripts in test-driven Golang
 * Added recursor functionality to Consul DNS server, which should solve many issues seen by users

#### Release Integration (cf-release, integration pipelines, DEA, Warden, HM9k)

 * Upgraded Postgres to 9.4.5 to address medium CVE (done by RelInt team because they picked up the story before Tracker split)
 * Cut v226 cf-release
 * Extracted uaa-release from cf-release, now BOSH and CF use the same release

 * Major update and simplification of docs for deploying CF (currently on docs-staging, not yet on docs.cloudfoundry.org)
 * Numerous community and pipeline things
