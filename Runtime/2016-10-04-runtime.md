## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.22.0 and 6.22.1:
  - Some regressions were not caught by our test sets, or for one case, we weren't running all the test sets.
  - With these releases we now have a reduced main help page;
  - Also, users can now use `apt-get install cf-cli` and `yum install cf-cli` to install, and keep up to date, the cf CLI as easy as it's been for Homebrew users on Mac OS X;
  - Finally, the Windows installer now exposes an option to install the cf CLI for just the current user, allowing users without administrator privileges to install the cf CLI.
- Next release will focus on fixing a number of community reported issues.
- Slowly picking up the refactor work again, which had been on hold whilst rebuilding the CI environment.
- The release after will focus on community requested features, as well as prelimenary work (or all of it, if there is a CF release with full support available by the time we get to the epic) for the V3 Tasks commands.
- Started an exploration to discover ways to format CLI output that are easier to parse by scripts.
- Also exploring container to container networking related workflows, and long-lived uaa tokens.
- Planning to remove the loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)) soon.
