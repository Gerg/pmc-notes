## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.22.2, a patch release addressing a handful of community reported issues. There are two additional reported issues (with `unbind-service` and `delete-orphaned-routes`) for which the commands were refactored into the new architecture first. As at the time of the release the refactor had not finished, the old implementations have been re-enabled and will be replaced in a future release soon.
- Working on the next feature release, which includes V3 tasks, long-lived uaa tokens, creating external users and updating port ranges of router groups.
- Audited all CLI owned public GitHub repos to ensure they have a correct NOTICE file.
- Exploring with a designer how to expose download & upload of staged application artefacts ("droplets").
- Started an exploration to discover ways to format CLI output that are easier to parse by scripts.
- Planning to remove the loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)) soon.
