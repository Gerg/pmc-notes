# Runtime PMC Meeting 2016-01-26

## Agenda
* Announcements
* PMC Lifecycle Activities
* Backlog Review

## Announcements
- decision for CF final release candidate SHA now happens via issues in a [Foundation repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-final-release-election) and involves PMs and anchors from all teams contributing to the core.
- Amit proposes to make this repo publicly viewable (main risk is we need to be careful when discussing CVEs in relation to approving/disapproving a candidate SHA)
- Release notes have a section on Job Spec Changes; Amit is asking PMs to contribute to this section when they contribute to the rest of the release notes.

## PMC Lifecycle Activities

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- CLI v6.15.0 was released 2 weeks ago exposing routes with path feature, and included IBM contributed language files for 9 languages. The next release, v6.16.0, is still a few weeks away and will expose Route services, TCP routing features and space-scoped service brokers.
- Completed CLI UX reviews with Shannon on stories on upcoming Routing features.
- 1 pair started v3 API stories and takes on ad hoc issues, the other, cross-team, pair continues on Routing stories 
- Looking into strategies to keep the language files up to date.
- Pairing with the Doc team on cleaning up the existing CLI documentation on docs.cloudfoundry.org - in particular removing the focus on v5 and v6 changes and v6 justifications.
- Working with the Doc Tools team to integrate a command reference guide generated from CLI help output.
- Working on a proposal for a cli command to check if it's the latest, potentially update itself.
- Pivotal engineer who's been visiting Sydney this month to ramp up a new Fujitsu engineer is returning to SF on Friday. Discussing with Chip tomorrow how to continue.

### Garden - Will Pragnell

- Adding rep bulk loops to BBS benchmark tests
- Saw that spreading out container starts produced some improvement in evacuation performance; will carry out change to the auction soon
- Suppressed noisy health-check log output, logging only health transitions
- Finished merging DATs into CATs, will soon switch CI only to run CATs in correct mode and remove the DATs
- Worked on upgrading to Go 1.5.3, only to find garden-linux won't run in inigo test suite; will wait for Go 1.6 release next week
- Planning to work with Loggregator team soon to enable executor-to-metron TCP commmunication
- Various improvements to logging, metrics, docs, and manifest generation

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell
- Performance analysis of Loggregator chain shows Metron is the bottleneck. Code profiling has identified several places for improvement. That work is underway.
