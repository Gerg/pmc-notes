## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per

### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Lots of time still being spent messing around with issues still being caused by regressions in 4.4 kernel
 - Aggressively prioritising work to make sure we can move to grootFS (see below) ASAP to avoid further 4.4 + AUFS + loop device issues
 - Intention is to deprecate and eventually remove the built-in rootfs management in garden-runc (which uses aufs) and require the use of grootfs (or a compatible `image_plugin`) both to side-step 4.4 kernel problems and to avoid maintaining two code bases that do the same thing longer than necessary
    - Requires groot being deployed in various pipelines and proving out its performance in real environments etc
 - Arranged to demo garden & groot to Kubernetes Node SIG next week
 - Preparing for Garden-Runc 1.1 which:
    - Does not require a patched `runc` (or compatible OCI runtime)
    - Ensures use of packaged `iptables-restore` binary
    - Adds proper `BulkNetOut` support for `network_plugin` consumers
    - Finalises v1 of the `image_plugin` API (used by groot) so folks can start migrating and testing
