## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per

### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Lots of time still being spent messing around with issues still being caused by regressions in 4.4 kernel
 - Aggressively prioritising work to make sure we can move to grootFS (see below) ASAP to avoid further 4.4 + AUFS + loop device issues
 - Intention is to deprecate and eventually remove the built-in rootfs management in garden-runc (which uses aufs) and require the use of grootfs (or a compatible `image_plugin`) both to side-step 4.4 kernel problems and to avoid maintaining two code bases that do the same thing longer than necessary
    - Requires groot being deployed in various pipelines and proving out its performance in real environments etc
 - Arranged to demo garden & groot to Kubernetes Node SIG next week
 - Preparing for Garden-Runc 1.1 which:
    - Does not require a patched `runc` (or compatible OCI runtime)
    - Ensures use of packaged `iptables-restore` binary
    - Adds proper `BulkNetOut` support for `network_plugin` consumers
    - Finalises v1 of the `image_plugin` API (used by groot) so folks can start migrating and testing

### GrootFS - Will Pragnell

- GATS (Garden acceptance tests) are green! \o/

### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran
- Spent most of last week bringing back environments affected by BOSH director vulnerability. 
- Released v0.8.0 last week, first release validated with `cf-deployment`
- Worked on security fixes and a bug fix that was affecting A1 and other environments
- Published a [blog post](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/meet-new-container-networking-stack-cloud-foundry/) on the Cloud Foundry blog

### Bits-Service - Simon Moser

- faced issues because of bosh director security vulernability ( lost working environment and pipelines for a while because bosh directors had to be destroyed) 
- chasing a mean bug that bits service was taking down NATS (found it by now - was because of CC Clock setting) 
- Therefore, still finishing up implementation of signed URLs in the bits-service itself (but getting close now)
