## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Continued investigation into poor performance creating containers, specifically an issue where container creation time on a long running Diego cell suddenly starts spiking. Current best theory is that we run out of guaranteed iops on AWS.
- Working on re-enableing various small features that were disabled as part of the switch to AUFS. Pretty close to getting back to the same feature set we had before.

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Has essentially been paused due to some vacations, conferences, etc.

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Mega - Amit Gupta

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell

### UAA - Sree Tummidi
 
### Lattice - David Wadden

### CAPI - Dieu Cao
