## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Continued investigation into poor performance creating containers, specifically an issue where container creation time on a long running Diego cell suddenly starts spiking. Current best theory is that we run out of guaranteed iops on AWS.
- Working on re-enableing various small features that were disabled as part of the switch to AUFS. Pretty close to getting back to the same feature set we had before.

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Has essentially been paused due to some vacations, conferences, etc.

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Performance:
	- Depth:
		- helped Garden team evaluate stability, performance of garden-linux aufs+loop devices solution for container file systems
		- working on improving the executor's caching of garden data to reduce latency of rep state calls
	- Breadth:
		- worked out an initial proposal for validating data load of 1000 reps communicating with the BBS, stories to come for a benchmark suite
		- investigating issues with etcd v2 ability to handling amount of data for 200K apps
	- Staging:
		- proposed an approach to bind-mounting downloaded assets (read: buildpacks), working out sequence of stories

- Garden safety:
	- the rep now fails on start-up if it gets an unrecoverable error from garden
	- working on having the executor check garden's ability to create and destroy containers periodically

- Test suites:
	- working with MEGA to make CATs target a specific backend
	- removed redundant DATs, will soon merge DATs into CATs

- Upgrade testing:
	- continuing work on automated test suite to verify downtimeless upgrades from 0.1434.0 to HEAD

- Miscellany:
	- various improvements to spiff-based manifest-generation templates and scripts
	- working with Greenhouse team to ensure all the cell-component test suites pass on Windows
