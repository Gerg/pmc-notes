## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Continued investigation into poor performance creating containers, specifically an issue where container creation time on a long running Diego cell suddenly starts spiking. Current best theory is that we run out of guaranteed iops on AWS.
- Working on re-enableing various small features that were disabled as part of the switch to AUFS. Pretty close to getting back to the same feature set we had before.

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Has essentially been paused due to some vacations, conferences, etc.

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Performance:
	- Depth:
		- helped Garden team evaluate stability, performance of garden-linux aufs+loop devices solution for container file systems
		- working on improving the executor's caching of garden data to reduce latency of rep state calls
	- Breadth:
		- worked out an initial proposal for validating data load of 1000 reps communicating with the BBS, stories to come for a benchmark suite
		- investigating issues with etcd v2 ability to handling amount of data for 200K apps
	- Staging:
		- proposed an approach to bind-mounting downloaded assets (read: buildpacks), working out sequence of stories

- Garden safety:
	- the rep now fails on start-up if it gets an unrecoverable error from garden
	- working on having the executor check garden's ability to create and destroy containers periodically

- Test suites:
	- working with MEGA to make CATs target a specific backend
	- removed redundant DATs, will soon merge DATs into CATs

- Upgrade testing:
	- continuing work on automated test suite to verify downtimeless upgrades from 0.1434.0 to HEAD

- Miscellany:
	- various improvements to spiff-based manifest-generation templates and scripts
	- working with Greenhouse team to ensure all the cell-component test suites pass on Windows


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Mega - Amit Gupta

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell

- Continuing work on TCP link Metron->Doppler
- Hardening Metron based on learnings from load tests done during TCP work
- Memory leak introduced in 223, fixed in 224

### UAA - Sree Tummidi
 
### Lattice - David Wadden
- Windows support added for Lattice in latest nightly builds
  - `vagrant up` / `terraform apply` brings up Linux cluster from Windows
  - ltc works from Windows
- Added `ltc sync` which auto-updates the CLI off the cluster
- Added `ltc version` which prints dependencies' versions from the cluster 
- Continued spike on supporting "cf push" on Lattice 
  - Addition of CC/UAA increases memory footprint by ~1.5GB, several GB download size
  - Responses from last meeting:
	- QUESTION: [AK] What's the difference between Lattice and BOSH-Lite in this case?
	- RESPONSE: [DW] Reduced deployment time through `vagrant up` with CF services already running
	- RESPONSE: [DW] The packer-bosh-deployed components don't run in Garden containers
	- FOLLOW-UP: [MS] Would like to see a proposal. How far down the path of enabling full local development of CF apps and services is the Lattice team planning to go?  For example, is there a plan to support brokered services?
	- RESPONSE: [DW] Brokered services can be BOSH-deployed if we include a BOSH director in a "special release" of Lattice
	- FOLLOW-UP: [AK] What will happen to the `ltc` CLI?
	- RESPONSE: [DW] Nothing for the time being, this can run alongside without impact.



### CAPI - Dieu Cao

- Continued working on modifying v3 end points to better separate lifecycle specific fields
- Completed switching v3 to action controller
	- easier onboarding for developers use to Rails applications
 	- now have access to Rails framework features and documentation
- Updated communication from CC to HM9000 to use the default cert store
- Plan to finish out work on support of private brokers for space developers in the next couple of weeks.
- Plan to work on detailing set of epic for CAPI to support Elastic Clusters
- Plan to work on an initial proposal for MVP support of Tasks in Cloud Controller
