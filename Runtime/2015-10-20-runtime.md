## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Nearing completion of CC API work to support Route Services feature. Next we'll begin CLI work.
- Routing API component, cuurently in cf-release, now serves endpoints for management of TCP routes; the independent TCP Routing API has been eliminated. Routing API is still considered experimental; a few backward incompatible chages are planned for the HTTP routes endpoints.
- We're working on high-availability features in cf-routing-release; API and emitters are now HA and we're working on the TCP routers.
- Making progress on support for TCP Routes in CC API; a few PRs to CLI have already been submitted


### Mega - Amit Gupta
##### Done:
- Extracted consul-release and building final releases in CI that get blessed in integration environment
- Setting up BOSH-Lite integration environment to bless BOSH-Lite stemcells (alongside existing AWS stemcells)
- Wrapped up final acceptance of BOSH stories to support specifying stemcell and release URLs in manifest, waiting on PR approval and BOSH pipelines
- Generic route registar supports tagging route registrations (useful for filtering metrics from gorouter)

##### In Progress:
- Digging deep into consul's actual ability to remain available during BOSH operations, writing automated tests
- Creating new tool to generate deployment manifests for cf for all use cases, leveraging BOSH features in PR
- Improving environment bootstrapping tool to generate credentials for user if not provided, for simpler bootstrap experience

##### Coming Up:
- Improving environment bootstrapping tool to support more generic use cases, not just Concourse or CF
- Improving CATS output and errand to facilitate debugging
- Investigating recommending cheaper RDS instance types

### LAMD - Jim Campbell
- Continuing work on TCP/TLS from Metron to Doppler
- Next up, performance eval of Loggregator chain
- Collector fully deprecated

### UAA - Sree Tummidi
- UAA Release 2.7.0.3 Released. Added support for Clients ID's longer than 36 Chars
- UAA Backwards Compatibility for OpenID Connect ID Token Response Type starting cf-release 220. Email has sent out to the community. We will be providing a 30 day window before reverting to support ID Token response type by default.
- UAA Release 2.7.1 Work Underway
  - Invitations API for external users
  - UAA & SAML Integration : Map SAML Roles/Group Memberships to OAuth Scopes, Expose SAML Claims in OpenID COnnect JWT token
- Investigating UAA Downtime in a HA environment during re-deploy [Details](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/issues/806)


### Lattice - David Wadden
- Exploring how to bring the developer experience on Lattice more in-line with the CF developer experience.
- Lattice [v0.6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice-release/releases/tag/v0.6.0) (Diego 0.1434.0) expected this week
- DigitalOcean, Google Compute Engine, Openstack platforms are temporarily discontinued until v0.7.0
  - Due to lack of support for base images / public snapshots on these platforms
- Primary repository has moved to [cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice-release/)
- Using packer-bosh to create cluster configurations instead of hand-rolled Upstart scripts
  - Improves stability, recent Diego changes had destabilized starting up cluster services.
  - Can more easily track upstream dependencies
- Default vagrant cluster can be reached via `ltc target local.lattice.cf`
- `USER` directives are honored from docker images (can also specify manually)
- `ltc` can define HTTP routes to fully-qualified domains and context paths [#104](cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice#104) [#217](cloudfoundry-incubator/lattice#217)

### CAPI - Dieu Cao
- Continued XTP with Routing on Route Services
- Removed route registration from CC, now using the route registrar job
- Modified a ccdb migration to support newer versions of mysql
- Working on modifying v3 end points to better separate lifecycle specific fields
- Working on support for app instance limits on space quota
- Working on switching v3 to action controller
- Spent time investigating/attempting to fix a few flaky tests
