##### Done:
- Extracted consul-release and building final releases in CI that get blessed in integration environment
- Setting up BOSH-Lite integration environment to bless BOSH-Lite stemcells (alongside existing AWS stemcells)
- Wrapped up final acceptance of BOSH stories to support specifying stemcell and release URLs in manifest, waiting on PR approval and BOSH pipelines
- Generic route registar supports tagging route registrations (useful for filtering metrics from gorouter)

##### In Progress:
- Digging deep into consul's actual ability to remain available during BOSH operations, writing automated tests
- Creating new tool to generate deployment manifests for cf for all use cases, leveraging BOSH features in PR
- Improving environment bootstrapping tool to generate credentials for user if not provided, for simpler bootstrap experience

##### Coming Up:
- Improving environment bootstrapping tool to support more generic use cases, not just Concourse or CF
- Improving CATS output and errand to facilitate debugging
- Investigating recommending cheaper RDS instance types
