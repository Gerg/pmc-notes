## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Close to releasing cf CLI 6.21.0 adding support for defining TCP routes and HTTP routes with paths in app manifests and updated message translations.
- Next will be the implementation of the [`cf help` redesign](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YasoPyhuajxcecV0QuFAtvnscR0ZZ1_vterDVXY8qDM/edit?usp=sharing).
- Converting internal golang imports to `code.cloudfoundry.org/cli` and commenced a refactor of the cf CLI codebase to remove anti-patterns and make it easier to learn for onboarding team members. The first step is to create an outershell with a command line option parser library that hooks into all existing commands. The library should help with the implementation of the new help design as well as future support for bash completion. The full refactoring will be ongoing work performed in parallel with continued feature work.
- Shared on CF Dev [our plan to remove the loggregator consumer library](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/) from the CLI, which may impact CLI users targeting a CF release <v203.
- Investigating software repo management options to enable users to download and update the cf CLI using apt-get.
