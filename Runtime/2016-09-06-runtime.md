## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Merged our refactoring branch into master, currently resolving inconsistencies in output of some commands.
- Completing the last story on [improving the UX](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YasoPyhuajxcecV0QuFAtvnscR0ZZ1_vterDVXY8qDM/edit?usp=sharing) of the main help page, added "see also" sections to individual help pages.
- Validating assumptions with IBM (who have been updating the translations of CLI messages) about the requirement and scope of localisation in the cf CLI: While maintaining the translated help pages, is there room for discontinuing the localisation of error messages? This came out of a realisation during the refactor work that quite an amount of engineering effort goes into maintaining internationalization support. Note that we won't make any changes without consulting the CF community.
- The next release will be after the discussion above is resolved and a number of (minor) help page improvements have been implemented.
- Looking into changing the Windows installer to allow users to install the cf CLI without requiring administrator access.
- Signing the RPMs with a Cloud Foundry Foundation certificate.
- Preparing to host an RPM package repository to allow users to install and update their cf CLI using `yum`.
- Considering to remove the loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)) soon after releasing the new help.
- Exploring how to expose V3 tasks through the cf CLI, as well as container to container networking related workflows, and long-lived uaa tokens.
