## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Completed new Diego-Enabler plugin commands to ease bulk migration of apps between Diego and DEA runtimes
- Completed cf CLI command reference guide (http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/cf-help.html, http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/push.html)
- Shared TCP routing App Manifest proposal, getting great feedback
- Changed CI pipeline to build CLI natively on MacOS instead of cross-compile to resolve some regressions
- Slowly progressing on exposing TCP Routing & multi app ports features
- Next CLI release will expose TCP routes and multiple app ports and expose app instance quotas.

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Found and fixed a bug where the `Containers()` method can deadlock. Shipping v0.336.0 this week with the fix.

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Steady progress towards feature completion for Cloud Foundry, though we found a handful of items that had been overlooked, which pushes the release marker about a week further out in Tracker.
- Incepted future security work last week. Notes have not been shared publicly yet due to concerns about security. That should be resolved soon - contact Will in the meantime if you'd like to see them.
- Discussions with the Diego team about validating that Guardian will perform as well or better than Garden-Linux are ongoing.
