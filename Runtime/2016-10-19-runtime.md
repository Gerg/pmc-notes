## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Still working on the next release, which focuses on fixing a number of community reported issues.
- Team is exploring the API workflow required for the new commands that expose V3 Tasks.
- After the patch release, considering a feature release that includes V3 tasks, long-lived uaa tokens, creating external users and updating port ranges of router groups.
- Started an exploration to discover ways to format CLI output that are easier to parse by scripts.
- Planning to remove the loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)) soon.
