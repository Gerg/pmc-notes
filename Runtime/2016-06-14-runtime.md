## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released [cf CLI v6.19.0](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/thread/OMJKSWFB4DEDC7MCTV4ONHFV2HATLJKB/), exposing space quota for reserved route ports, fixing a few regressions in v6.18.x, removing profanity and swear words from the dictionary used to generate ramdom host names, and displaying suggestions when mistyping commands
- The next release will support HTTP routes with paths as well as TCP routes in app manifests
- Working with the Docs team on improving CLI docs
- About to restart exploration with a UX designer on improving the UX of `cf help`
- Exploring the feasibility of an alternative solution to make it easier for users to update their CLI, which is to make them available in software repos accessible from apt-get and yum
