## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released [cf CLI v6.19.0](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/thread/OMJKSWFB4DEDC7MCTV4ONHFV2HATLJKB/), exposing space quota for reserved route ports, fixing a few regressions in v6.18.x, removing profanity and swear words from the dictionary used to generate ramdom host names, and displaying suggestions when mistyping commands
- The next release will support HTTP routes with paths as well as TCP routes in app manifests
- Working with the Docs team on improving CLI docs
- About to restart exploration with a UX designer on improving the UX of `cf help`
- Exploring the feasibility of an alternative solution to make it easier for users to update their CLI, which is to make them available in software repos accessible from apt-get and yum

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Shipped v0.338.0 - only change from v0.337.0 is a "safety guard" to prevent multiple containers with the same IP address from being created. We saw this bug occur in a PCF customer environment, but haven't been able to reproduce the issue.

- Slow week last week, all Pivotal folks on the team tied up with Pivotal support issues
- Shipped v0.3.0
  - BOSH properties are now more consistent with Garden-Linux

- Hoping to start security work this week
