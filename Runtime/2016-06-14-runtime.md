## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released [cf CLI v6.19.0](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/thread/OMJKSWFB4DEDC7MCTV4ONHFV2HATLJKB/), exposing space quota for reserved route ports, fixing a few regressions in v6.18.x, removing profanity and swear words from the dictionary used to generate ramdom host names, and displaying suggestions when mistyping commands
- The next release will support HTTP routes with paths as well as TCP routes in app manifests
- Working with the Docs team on improving CLI docs
- About to restart exploration with a UX designer on improving the UX of `cf help`
- Exploring the feasibility of an alternative solution to make it easier for users to update their CLI, which is to make them available in software repos accessible from apt-get and yum

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Shipped v0.338.0 - only change from v0.337.0 is a "safety guard" to prevent multiple containers with the same IP address from being created. We saw this bug occur in a PCF customer environment, but haven't been able to reproduce the issue.

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Slow week last week, all Pivotal folks on the team tied up with Pivotal support issues
- Shipped v0.3.0
  - BOSH properties are now more consistent with Garden-Linux
  - Logging improvements
  - The head of the NetIn port allocation queue is now persisted across Garden server restarts (but not VM recreation)
- Hoping to start security work this week

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Almost done with Postgres support in BBS
- BBS automatically migrates data from etcd to a relational store
- Improved documentation and manifest generation for supporting the BBS in relational-store mode
- Cells can now verify checksums for downloaded assets
- Cells will use BOSH 2.0 AZ property if available
- Cells wait to report as started until they can set cell presence
- Still waiting on larger-scale test environment, believe blocked on BOSH v257 release


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Infrastructure - Amit Gupta

### Release Integration - Amit Gupta

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel
- Improving evacuation, removing the Evacuator
- CPU percentage is not displayed correctly via CLI (fix is almost ready)

### CAPI - Nicholas Calugar
- Shared and Private Domain resources now return non-deprecated URLs
- Application Security Group entries support a description field to annotate what the entry is for
- Retries around blobstore operations
- Services API supports "operation" param when doing asynchronous operations
  - The param will be sent back to the service broker when Cloud Controller polls the last_operation endpoint
  - Enables stateless service brokers in certain cases, e.g. a BOSH backed service can use the task id to help determine state of last operation
- V3
  - Route mapping supports non-default port
  - Focused on v3-migration epic: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/2496795
