## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Planning a cf CLI 6.29.1 release this week, resolving two reported minor regressions (in `api` and `auth`). ([Release notes draft](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149907050)).
- Spiking on `v3-ssh`. Continuing to cross-pair with CAPI on V3 commands.
- Planning to cross-pair with Container Networking later this week on their plugin commands.
- Lots of progress on `push` refactor. Service bindings in manifest almost delivered. Left to do are manifest inheritance and route support.
