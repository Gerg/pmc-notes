## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Planning a cf CLI 6.29.1 release this week, resolving two reported minor regressions (in `api` and `auth`). ([Release notes draft](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149907050)).
- Spiking on `v3-ssh`. Continuing to cross-pair with CAPI on V3 commands.
- Planning to cross-pair with Container Networking later this week on their plugin commands.
- Lots of progress on `push` refactor. Service bindings in manifest almost delivered. Left to do are manifest inheritance and route support.
- Participated in security inception two weeks ago. Intend to share concern about plugins with CFF this week.
- Upcoming release plans:
  - V3 commands for CF community to start trying out. Zach & Mike to work on documentation explaining newly enabled workflows.
  - Container networking plugin commands in cf CLI.
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user).
  - Misc. `login` features, such as displaying the last login time.

### Garden - Julz Friedman

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

* Two tracks in flight:
  - Finishing rootless (creating container as non-root user) stories for the XFS driver
  - Working on OCI Image support - this is to enable Garden's OCI Buildpacks work
* No long-running D-state processes have been found so far - the GrootFS team believes that it is safe to start migrating to GrootFS.
* Next couple of weeks:
  - We will update OS docs to introduct GrootFS.
  - Cache management stories are expected to land.
