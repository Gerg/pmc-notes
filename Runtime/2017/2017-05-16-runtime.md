## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Plan for cf CLI with DEA phase-out documented in [release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140879877).
- Nearing completion of release focusing on UX improvements and bug fixes around plugin installation and management.
  - Rebranding the plugins.cloudfoundry.org site: updating the logo, aligning with www.cloudfoundry.org styling.
- Progressing on v2 push refactor, target of private docker registry and droplet upload support.
- Upcoming releases focus on catch-up with CC/UAA exposed functionality (space scoped staging application security groups, org default isolation segments, last login time, private docker registry and droplet upload support).
  - Completed refactor of application security group (ASG) related commands that we're enhancing in the next release to expose space scoped staging ASGs. Refactor of `login` next.
