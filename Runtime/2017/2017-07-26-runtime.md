## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion
- Proposal to develop & maintain a PMC/CFF-wide high-level roadmap to improve transparency and give each other and CF Community a quick overview of what we're working on, what we are expecting. See appendix. [Dies Köper]


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies Köper
- Released cf CLI 6.29.0, exposing org default isolation segments. ([Release notes here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.29.0)).
- Change from previously shared plan:
  - New milestone to complete (or at least spike on) v3 app commands to allow CAPI to GA the V3 API with more confidence.
  - Next release to make production ready the V3 commands, fleshed out UX, etc. for CF community to start trying out. Zach & Mike to work on documentation explaining newly enabled workflows.
- Subsequent releases adding features to `login`, such as displaying the last login time, as well as incorporating container to container networking commands (now in plugin).

### Garden - Julz Friedman

- OCI Track
  - Good progress on phase one (using layers to make performance better / avoid stream-in without any UX changes), PRs made to capi and diego and basic flow starting to come together.
  - Built simple tooling and dashboard to measure current performance ready to compare against new flow
  - Looking forward: after phase one is complete, phase two is to benchmark performance of larger-scale changes to quantify value of future work (so phase three may or may not happen, based on results of phase two)
- Rootless RunC Track
  - Final stories from this track now being completed, including properly limiting device access in rootless containers.
  - Looking forward: considering what steps remain for us to feel confident turning rootless mode on in production
- Garden-on-windows
  - Various changes to enable the garden-windows team to reuse guardian on windows
  - Now possible to run guardian on windows as well as linux. On linux, guardian uses `runc` to run containers, on windows the garden-windows team have written a `winc` binary that uses windows API to create and run containers. This allow lots of nice code sharing between garden and linux and ensures a much more consistent experience for platform users.
- Other Stuff
  - Investigating being able to work with hardened-umask stemcells
  - Better behaviour for reconnecting to containers over garden restart

### GrootFS - George Lestaris
- [GrootFS 0.21.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-release/releases/tag/v0.21.0) is now on 100% of cells in PWS, along with [GrootFS Diagnostics 0.2.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs-diagnostics-release/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
  - GrootFS Diagnostics is a new BOSH release to aid D-state detection:
    - detects persistent D-state when it occurs
    - collects logs related to D-state processes
    - raises alerts via Datadog and our [Lakitu pipeline](https://concourse.lakitu.cf-app.com/teams/cf-grootfs/pipelines/grootfs-diagnostics)
    - ships logs off affected cells to a secure S3 bucket for further analysis by the team
    - blog post in collaboration with CloudOps coming soon
  - So far, the persistent D-state issue we saw on the first PWS rollout has **not** recurred
    - We are, however, seeing the odd case where `monit` enters D-state for > 120s, before recovering. It's not clear why
  - Attempts to [reproduce and understand persistent D-state](https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1epMKlSKSqRybS4vHssCctEPhZJF4TWpexamv5nadkoo/edit?usp=sharing) continue
- Investigation continues into [performance spikes in PWS](https://docs.google.com/a/pivotal.io/document/d/1xRX0lW3zzHJisZlAJ_70yYR1LRiUAYS_5DXVlxI-GiY/edit?usp=sharing) and Vizzini test environments
  - spikes seem to be split between cases where GrootFS is the majority of time, and Guardian is taking the majority of time
- Support added for rootless `stats` and `create` with quotas on Overlay+XFS

### Greenhouse - A William Martin

- Have successfully cf-pushed a .NET application to a Windows 2016 container using the Buildpack App Lifecycle.
- `winc` can create host container port mappings for Windows Server Containers
- Updated to use runtime spec 1.0.0-rc6.
- Enabled Diego app healthcheck on Win 2016.
- Built CF rootfs based on Microsoft-provided Windows Server Core base container image.
- Enabled configurable max process count for an IronFrame container on 2012R2.
- Windows 2016 containers respect application memory limits.

### Diego - Eric Malm

### CF Roadmap Proposal - Dies
I want to propose we develop & maintain a PMC/CF-wide high-level roadmap to improve transparency and give each other and CF Community a quick overview of what we're working on, what we are expecting. Example:

When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - DEA end of life
|| - Isolation segments for both compute and routing
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
||
|| **cf-release EOF** (2 months after GA):
|| - No more releases of cf-release
|| - Any new CF features available only in cf-deployment
||
|| - Multi-factor authentication in cf CLI
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - V3 app features (multiple processes, rollback)
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Container to container networking exposed in CLI
|| - Multiple buildpacks per app
||
*Future* | - .NET support on Windows Server 2016
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*

*Notes:*
- Nothing in here binds us, no commitments on if and when anything will end up being delivered
- No dates intentional. I see "Soon" as MVP in users' hands in 2-3 months, "Next" a bit further out, "Future" so far out your guess is as good as mine.
- Include only "high level" features
- Include hyperlinks to proposals, tracker marker, etc. for people to find more info
- Expectation PMs update every few months or so
- Open to different formats, suggestions where to host (final goal is to be on CFF site)
