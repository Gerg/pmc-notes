## Appendix
### CF Roadmap Proposal - Dies
I want to propose we develop & maintain a PMC/CF-wide high-level roadmap to improve transparency and give each other and CF Community a quick overview of what we're working on, what we are expecting. Example:

When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - DEA end of life
|| - Isolation segments for both compute and routing
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
||
|| **cf-release EOF** (2 months after GA):
|| - No more releases of cf-release
|| - Any new CF features available only in cf-deployment
||
|| - Multi-factor authentication in cf CLI
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - V3 app features (multiple processes, rollback)
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Container to container networking exposed in CLI
|| - Multiple buildpacks per app
||
*Future* | - .NET support on Windows Server 2016
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*

*Notes:*
- Nothing in here binds us, no commitments on if and when anything will end up being delivered
- No dates intentional. I see "Soon" as MVP in users' hands in 2-3 months, "Next" a bit further out, "Future" so far out your guess is as good as mine.
- Include only "high level" features
- Include hyperlinks to proposals, tracker marker, etc. for people to find more info
- Expectation PMs update every few months or so
- Open to different formats, suggestions where to host (final goal is to be on CFF site)
