## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- No major updates since 2 weeks ago:
- Plan for cf CLI with DEA phase-out documented in [release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/140879877). After the upcoming release we will email CF Dev with the intention to move the Diego-Enabler plugin to the attic. No rush.
- Very nearly completing cf CLI release focusing on UX improvements and bug fixes around plugin installation and management.
- Cross-pairing with CAPI on v3 app commands (subcommands that together lead to & make up v3-push). When this set has completed, we will take some time exploring new workflows. For now the commands are bare-bones and need to be revisited before publicly exposing them.
