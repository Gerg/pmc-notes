## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.31.0 with Docker image support in the app manifest. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.31.0))
- Considering whether to release with a subset of experimental V3 commands (for multiple buildpack support) this week, and release again next week to expose the rest (multiple processes, granular push control) to give us more time to prepare documentation on granular commands, or release all together. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149541909))
- Continuing work on V3 commands (`v3-set-env`, `v3-env`, ...) and preparation for `v3-ssh`
    - Expecting subsequent releases to apply user feedback, as well as taking advantage of post-GA CC V3 API improvements.
- Progress on `push` refactor:
  - Exploring calling back to old `push` implementation for outstanding features so we can start releasing it for user evaluation (and in particular, consumption by CATS and other test sets). Outstanding `push` features include app manifest with global attributes, "inherit" or route attributes other than "routes", as well as route related flags (`-d`, `--hostname`, ...). ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151113529))
- Further out:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Droplet upload
  - Service instance sharing
  - Last login time displayed on `login`

### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Let's get ready to rootless: rootless garden work complete, going to attempt to enable feature flag on PWS and - if stable - will start transitioning to this as new default.
 - OCI phase one: still blocked on groot, hopefully unblocked tomorrow then ready to be enabled experimentally.
 - Sidecar containers: design document circulating, intend to incept on this in next 2-3 weeks (taking the space opened up by completion of rootless track)
 - Umask-hardened stemcell compatibility: current release makes garden compatible with umask-hardened stemcell, next garden release makes garden fully take advantage of new umask hardening rules

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia

### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Zach Robinson

### Services API - Matthew McNeeney
- Designed a number of CC API endpoint options for service instance sharing and discussing with CAPI team which one to proceed with
- Changed service broker catalog validation logic to stop requiring `"type": "object"` and `$schema` fields to improve support for service authors wanting to use draft 6 of JSON schema (instead of the recommended draft 4)
- Added a `context` object to the request made to service brokers to create new service bindings (contains platform-specific information - `space_guid` and `organization_guid`)
- Updated CC API documentation to include [schemas](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng/pull/890) changes

### Permissions - Chris Brown

* Added a feature flag to CC which causes it to use perm
* Send all of the new role assignments to perm (un-assignments not done yet!)
* Investigated the `cf-mgmt` tool which customers are using at the moment

Next steps:

* Send all un-assignments to perm too
* Persist the assignments in perm
* Migrate existing assignments to perm in the background
