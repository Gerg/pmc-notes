## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Currently working on release focusing on UX improvements and bug fixes around plugin installation and management.
- Completed refactor of application security group (ASG) related commands that we're enhancing in the next release to expose space scoped ASGs.
- Restarted v2 push refactor, target of private docker registry and droplet upload support.
- Upcoming releases focus on catch-up with CC/UAA exposed functionality (space scoped application security groups, org default isolation segments, last login time, private docker registry and droplet upload support).

### Garden - Julz Friedman

### GrootFS - George Lestaris


### Greenhouse - A William Martin

- No update.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Updated diego-release to Golang 1.8.1, which fixes droplet caching
- Conducted some initial reproduction work around healthcheck stability
- Accommodated cflinuxfs2 release rename
- Fixed executor bug where process invocation could block forever, exacerbated by garden-runc spawning bug
- Fixed indexing bug in LRP convergence
- Instance guids now fit into iptables logging prefixes without truncation
- Contributed local-route-emitter and locket changes to cf-deployment
- Upcoming:
  - Continuing with v2 Loggregator API support across Diego components
  - Improve LRP health-check efficiency, reliability with more declarative specification
  - Support CAPI in performing zero-downtime app updates


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`
- More flexible links in latest release

#### `etcd-release`
- First steps in Golang init scripts

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)
- AWS terraform opt-in features complete (will be mandatory in bbl 4.0)

### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`

#### `cf-deployment`
- Major work on migration from cf-release to cf-deployment
  - Tool to extract a vars-store from a given CF and Diego manifest.
  - Successfully CI'ing a migration from cf-release to cf-deployment.
    Next, we want to make assertions about uptime during the transition.
- Ops-files
  - Experimental ops-files for deploying with locket
- Updates
  - Garden debug server enabled by default
  - Routing API deployed by default. TCP routing still requires an ops-file.
    This should allow deployers to take advantage of other routing features,
    such as routing isolation segments.
  - Automatically updating garden-windows-release and hwc-buildpack-release
    (as we do with other releases).
