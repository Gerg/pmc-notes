## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.23.0 last month, with support for V3 tasks, long-lived uaa tokens and creation of external users (e.g ldap)
- Expecting to release cf CLI 6.23.1 this week, addressing a regression with the refactored `delete-org` command that has affected some CI environments, continuing (instead of aborting) `push` when the resource matching API times out, `run-task` community feedback and ensuring all our cf CLI binaries and installers include up-to-date license and attribution notices.
- Plan for the next release includes:
  - removing of loggregator consumer library (see [plan here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/))  

  and one or more of:
  - exposing isolation segments
  - exposing a new health check type that monitors a path on the app instances
  - uploading of droplets
  - updating port ranges of router groups
- Almost ready to share a proposal on JSON formatted output of CLI commands for easier scripting.
