## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.29.1, resolving two reported minor regressions (in `api` and `auth`) and improved prevention of corrupting local config.json. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.29.1)).
- Nearing release exposing experimental v3 app commands for community feedback. Based on GA'ed CC API.  ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149541909)).
  - Expecting another release to follow applying user feedback, as well as taking advantage of API improvements CAPI is making post-GA.
  - Reaching out to original `cf ssh` developer to help us understand the `ssh` code so we can refactor it and make it work for V3 app processes.
- Completed cross-pairing with Container Networking. Reviewing PR that brings in the 3 network plugin commands.
- Progress on `push` refactor. Left to do are app manifest inheritance and route support.
  - Service bindings in manifest delivered
  - Refactoring `create-route` in parallel to speed up manifest route support work
- Various features pending the groundwork on v2-push and V3 commands above: Docker image support in manifest, droplet upload, ...
- Also planning:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - Displaying last login time on `login`

### Garden - Julz Friedman

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

* Psst couple of weeks:
  - We cut v0.25.0 with two security fixes.
  - We finished v0.26.0 (we will cut it tomorrow). It includes features that help Garden work with OCI Images (OCI Buildpacks narrative).
  - We submitted a couple PRs to the CFF Docs in order to properly introduce and discuss GrootFS.
* Next couple of weeks:
  - Starting work on cache management soon (late this week or next week).
  - Wrapping up rootless work (one story to go) for the Overlay-XFS driver.

### Greenhouse - Colin Jackson
  - Ran 115 instances of the Nora testing app on a single Windows 2016 Diego cell
  - Finished the parity work between 2012R2 and 2016, meaning that everything the old Garden-Windows release did, now winc does in its place
  - garden-runc on Windows limits disk and memory limits, and CPU share allocation is underway
  - Apps can be pushed to the windows2016 stack with a buildpack git url
  - Application security groups have been implemented for 2016

- Exploring BBS benchmark performance with LRP update API spike code
- Starting work to run Envoy proxy sidecars in support of routing integrity
