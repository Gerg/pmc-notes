## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.29.1, resolving two reported minor regressions (in `api` and `auth`) and improved prevention of corrupting local config.json. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.29.1)).
- Nearing release exposing experimental v3 app commands for community feedback. Based on GA'ed CC API.  ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149541909)).
  - Expecting another release to follow applying user feedback, as well as taking advantage of API improvements CAPI is making post-GA.
  - Reaching out to original `cf ssh` developer to help us understand the `ssh` code so we can refactor it and make it work for V3 app processes.
- Completed cross-pairing with Container Networking. Reviewing PR that brings in the 3 network plugin commands.
- Progress on `push` refactor. Left to do are app manifest inheritance and route support.
  - Service bindings in manifest delivered
  - Refactoring `create-route` in parallel to speed up manifest route support work
- Various features pending the groundwork on v2-push and V3 commands above: Docker image support in manifest, droplet upload, ...
- Also planning:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - Displaying last login time on `login`
