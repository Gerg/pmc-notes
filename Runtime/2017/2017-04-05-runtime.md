## Discussion


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Very close to releasing cf CLI 6.26.0 exposing isolation segments. Reasons for the delay include updating the CI environment from bosh-lite on AWS to full bosh & cf-deployment (we need multiple Diego cells to test iso segs) on GCP (lower cost), additional feature stories stemming from a UX review of the current isolation segments related command set and current CF release, and regressions in commands that mix V2 and V3 CC APIs.
- Next release will focus on UX improvements and bug fixes around plugin installation and management.
- Cross-paired with CAPI on V3 create-app and create-package. Expecting to pick up V3 staging in a week or two when related CAPI changes have completed. These commands are for now hidden, marked experimental and whether they'll be absorbed into V3 push and other commands or will also be exposed as is will be considered later.
- Exploring CLI UX for private docker registries - shared summary on CF Dev and received positive feedback on suggested UX.

### Garden - Julz Friedman

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

* Deploying to 50% of PWS today.
 - We found an issue in PWS (caused by a race between `grootfs create` and `grootfs stats`). It's fixed in the latest release.
* Released [v0.16.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/grootfs/releases/tag/v0.16.0) today: 
  - This release contains some of the features required to enable a less "manual" (and more tested) store management (`grootfs init-store` and `grootfs delete-store` calls).
  - We have found a way around the Kernel limitations, in order to implement rootless with the Overlay-XFS file system driver. v0.16.0 introduces two feature flags in `grootfs create` (`--json` and `--without-mount`) to start shifting the Garden-Groot contract in order to enable the rootless-Overlay-XFS work.

### Greenhouse - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Resolved BBS performance degradation with 1000 locket-based cell registrations with MySQL tuning
- Cells can opt into using new v2 Loggregator API for rep component metrics (except for the Golang runtime metrics)
- Cells support mutual TLS for asset uploads and downloads
- Finishing up TCP route-registrations from the local route-emitters
- Finishing up rotation of instance-identity credentials before end of validity
- Improving locket operability in advance of recommending use for BBS and auctioneer locks
- Upcoming:
  - Continuing with v2 Loggregator API support across Diego components
  - Improve LRP health-check efficiency, reliability with more declarative specification
  - Support CAPI in performing zero-downtime app updates
