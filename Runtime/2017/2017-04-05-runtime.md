- Proposal to incubate haproxy-boshrelease by Geoff Franks of Stark & Wayne

## Discussion


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Very close to releasing cf CLI 6.26.0 exposing isolation segments. Reasons for the delay include updating the CI environment from bosh-lite on AWS to full bosh & cf-deployment (we need multiple Diego cells to test iso segs) on GCP (lower cost), additional feature stories stemming from a UX review of the current isolation segments related command set and current CF release, and regressions in commands that mix V2 and V3 CC APIs.
- Next release will focus on UX improvements and bug fixes around plugin installation and management.
- Cross-paired with CAPI on V3 create-app and create-package. Expecting to pick up V3 staging in a week or two when related CAPI changes have completed. These commands are for now hidden, marked experimental and whether they'll be absorbed into V3 push and other commands or will also be exposed as is will be considered later.
- Exploring CLI UX for private docker registries - shared summary on CF Dev and received positive feedback on suggested UX.
