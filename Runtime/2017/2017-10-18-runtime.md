## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per

- Continuing work on V3 commands (`v3-ssh`)
    - Expecting subsequent releases to apply user feedback, as well as taking advantage of post-GA CC V3 API improvements.
- Progress on `push` refactor:
  - Ran and passed CATS.
  - Calling back to old `push` implementation for outstanding features so we can start releasing it for user evaluation (especially app manifest inheritance, global attributes, and route attributes other than "routes"). 
  - Working on last outstanding `push` feature: route related flags (`-d`, `--hostname`, ...). 
  - ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151113529))
- Dr. Max left our team but may return to continue work on i18n support and interaction with translation contributors.
- Started `service` refactor in preparation of service instance sharing support, with SAPI and CAPI teams
- Further out:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Droplet upload
  - Last login time displayed on `login`
