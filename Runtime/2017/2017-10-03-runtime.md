## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.32.0 with experimental V3 commands for multiple processes, granular push control and multiple buildpack support. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.32.0))
- Added [documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/self-signed.html) that since the 6.31.0 release, which was built with Golang 1.9, the cf CLI accepts CA certs from `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_PATH` environment variables on Linux for TLS validation of API endpoints.
- Continuing work on V3 commands (`v3-create-package -p`, `.cfignore`) and preparation for `v3-ssh`
    - Expecting subsequent releases to apply user feedback, as well as taking advantage of post-GA CC V3 API improvements.
- Progress on `push` refactor:
  - Exploring calling back to old `push` implementation for outstanding features so we can start releasing it for user evaluation (and in particular, consumption by CATS and other test sets). Outstanding `push` features include app manifest with global attributes, "inherit" or route attributes other than "routes", as well as route related flags (`-d`, `--hostname`, ...). ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151113529))
- Dr. Max joining our team for 2 weeks to improve our i18n support and interaction with translation contributors.
- Further out:
  - Service instance sharing
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Droplet upload
  - Last login time displayed on `login`

### Garden - Julz Friedman


### GrootFS - George Lestaris

#### Past couple of weeks

* Cut v0.26.0 with all the rootless and most of the OCI Buildpacks work.
* Have been trying to reduce the surface area of GrootFS by removing unused BOSH properties and features.
* Updated CF docs to create custom stacks that work with CF.
* _Cache managememt_ work in flight.
* _OCI Buildpacks_ feature to dowload droplets has been delivered today.

#### Next couple of weeks

* We should be finishing the _cache management_ track.
* We need to add one more feature for OCI buildpacks to work rootless.
* Scoping and possibly incepting work with Garden Windows.

### Garden-Windows - Colin Jackson


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished configuring Envoy proxy to host instance-identity certificate
- Updating BBS benchmarks to work with LRP convergence enabled
- Option to override Docker image used in CATs to work around inability to run Envoy proxy in some Docker containers
- Added instance guid to instance-identity cert as a DNS SAN in anticipation of gorouter adoption of Golang 1.9
- Configuring cf-deployment components to use Locket by default
- Improved resilience of Locket to MySQL connection errors
- Upcoming:
  - Start implementing APIs for rolling updates of LRPs
  - Run system container processes (long-running healthchecks, Envoy) as Garden sidecars
  - Investigate rebalancing strategies for "boulder" app instance placement


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`

#### `etcd-release`

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)

### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`

#### `cf-deployment`

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`

#### `cf-smoke-tests`

#### `nats-release`

### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

- no update

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia

### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Zach Robinson

### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

- OSBAPI v2.13 released; CF already fully supports this and the CC advertises v2.13 in the header sent to brokers
- Includes ability for service brokers to advertise schemas declaring the configuration parameters they can accept for creating a service instance, updating a service instance and creating a service binding (see [release notes](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/master/release-notes.md))
- Continued work on service instance sharing track
- Investigating some permissions issues regarding visibility of service instances and bindings in different spaces

### Permissions - Christopher Brown

* Role creations and deletions are now propagated to the service. We're still
  looking for all the edge cases when this can happen.

* We're getting the service production ready: metrics, logs, access logs,
  service discovery, etc.

Next steps:

* Persistence of the data into a database.

* A migration tool to move the permissions data from Cloud Controller to Perm.

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj

### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran

### Bits-Service - Simon Moser
