## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.32.0 with experimental V3 commands for multiple processes, granular push control and multiple buildpack support. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.32.0))
- Added [documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/self-signed.html) that since the 6.31.0 release, which was built with Golang 1.9, the cf CLI accepts CA certs from `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_PATH` environment variables on Linux for TLS validation of API endpoints.
- Continuing work on V3 commands (`v3-create-package -p`, `.cfignore`) and preparation for `v3-ssh`
    - Expecting subsequent releases to apply user feedback, as well as taking advantage of post-GA CC V3 API improvements.
- Progress on `push` refactor:
  - Exploring calling back to old `push` implementation for outstanding features so we can start releasing it for user evaluation (and in particular, consumption by CATS and other test sets). Outstanding `push` features include app manifest with global attributes, "inherit" or route attributes other than "routes", as well as route related flags (`-d`, `--hostname`, ...). ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151113529))
- Dr. Max joining our team for 2 weeks to improve our i18n support and interaction with translation contributors.
- Further out:
  - Service instance sharing
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Droplet upload
  - Last login time displayed on `login`

### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Configuring cf-deployment components to use Locket by default
- Improved resilience of Locket to MySQL connection errors
- Upcoming:
