## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion
- Proposal to develop & maintain a PMC/CFF-wide high-level feature roadmap to improve transparency and give CF Community a quick overview of what we're working on, what they can expect. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#). [Dies Köper]

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies Köper
- Released cf CLI 6.30.0, exposing policy management commands for direct network traffic between apps. Most work was done by the Container Networking team. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.30.0)).
- Released cf CLI 6.29.2, resolving regressions in `auth` and `ssh-code` in 6.29.1 caused by confusion which exposed endpoints to use. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.29.2)).
- Work on two parallel tracks - not sure yet which will be released first:
  - App manifest support for Docker apps. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/150627476)).
  - Exposing experimental v3 app commands for community feedback. Based on GA'ed CC API and includes multiple buildpack support. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149541909))
    - Expecting subsequent releases to apply user feedback, as well as taking advantage of post-GA API improvements.
    - Pairing with original `cf ssh` developer to help us understand the `ssh` code and refactor it for use with V3 app processes.
- Progress on `push` refactor: app manifest inheritance and route support left
  - Refactoring `create-route` in parallel to speed up manifest route support work
- Also planning:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Droplet upload
  - Service instance sharing
  - Last login time displayed on `login`
