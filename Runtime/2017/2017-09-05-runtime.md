## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion
- Proposal to develop & maintain a PMC/CFF-wide high-level feature roadmap to improve transparency and give CF Community a quick overview of what we're working on, what they can expect. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#). [Dies Köper]

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies Köper
- Released cf CLI 6.30.0, exposing policy management commands for direct network traffic between apps. Most work was done by the Container Networking team. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.30.0)).
- Released cf CLI 6.29.2, resolving regressions in `auth` and `ssh-code` in 6.29.1 caused by confusion which exposed endpoints to use. ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.29.2)).
- Work on two parallel tracks - not sure yet which will be released first:
  - App manifest support for Docker apps. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/150627476)).
  - Exposing experimental v3 app commands for community feedback. Based on GA'ed CC API and includes multiple buildpack support. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/149541909))
    - Expecting subsequent releases to apply user feedback, as well as taking advantage of post-GA API improvements.
    - Pairing with original `cf ssh` developer to help us understand the `ssh` code and refactor it for use with V3 app processes.
- Progress on `push` refactor: app manifest inheritance and route support left
  - Refactoring `create-route` in parallel to speed up manifest route support work
- Also planning:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Droplet upload
  - Service instance sharing
  - Last login time displayed on `login`

### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - OCI mode "Phase One" (i.e. using layered filesystem instead of StreamIn)
   - Working end-to-end apart from final features from GrootFS, hope to be able to start testing this in real environments soon

- Rootless Mode (i.e. garden does not run as root and therefore a garden exploit does not buy you host root priviledges)
   - Largely complete, making final preparations to have this turned on in a subset of PWS
   - Upshot: need to disable privileged containers, since with rootless mode turned on privileged containers cannot be created
     - Writing note to send to cf-dev about this, tl;dr: we will need to start recommending any remaining privileged containers are migrated in readiness for making Rootless the default

- Sidecar Proposal (i.e. ability to create container processes that have their own root filesystem but share networks)
   - Needed by Envoy proxies and useful for healthcheck containers etc
   - Share same network as outer container, but own root filesystem
   - Should be quite easy to do given guardian's underlying implementation, will create a proposal for this and circulate with windows team to ensure we can do it on both platforms
   
- Upcoming
   - OCI Phase 2 (Experiment to determine performance impact of using OCI Images to allow custom root filesystems for buildpacks) 
   - Sidecars


### GrootFS - George Lestaris

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished initial exploration of BBS benchmark performance with LRP update API spike code
