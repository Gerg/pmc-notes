## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per


### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Garden-runc 1.2 released with lots of nice new stuff - Highlights:
  - Docker Auth (requires an image_plugin that supports this, built in rootfs manager does not)
  - NetIn/Out moved to Create for c2c
  - RunC bumped to latest version
  - Inspector-garden is gone!!
  - iptables rules now have container guid in comment field!
- Ongoing: Rootless Garden work continues, `experimental_rootless` bosh flag allows opting in
  - can start up garden without root
  - progressing through allowing creating containers without root
- Upcoming:
  - Next release: CPU Maximums
  - Release after that: Better DNS (to support Bosh DNS use case etc), Performance Baseline with "Bucketbench tool"

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

### Greenhouse - A William Martin

- Inception on Windows Server 2016 Containers this past Friday. Will circulate results soon. Quick summary: Investigate OCI-compliant Garden/HCSSCIM layer. Risk: possible dependency on Docker for image layers.
- Aiming to promote `garden-windows-bosh-release` out of the incubator soon.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing with experimental work to store BBS and auctioneer locks in BBS DB instead of Consul
- Finishing initial work on providing instance-identity credentials in containers
- Route-emitter can connect to NATS via link
- Can opt into grootfs via manifest generation
- SSH-proxy can communicate to UAA via internal DNS
- Diego repositories enforce canonical code.cloudfoundry.org import path
- Upcoming:
  - Investigating strategies to migrate cell-presence registrations from consul to the BBS API/DB
  - Local route-emitters register TCP routes in addition to HTTP routes
  - Finish remaining BBS API commands for `cfdot`


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`

#### `etcd-release`

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)

### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`
- Removed deprecated properties from manifest generation
- Changes to manifest generation that allow consul-release to ship links
- Use statsd-injector-release instead of loggregator for statsd-injector job (PR)

#### `cf-deployment`
- Pipeline/testing improvements
  - Pipeline performs a dry-run deploy before updating develop branch with new releases.
This test should catch updates that introduce new required properties.
  - Added a release-candidate branch. Currently follows master,
but we'll soon have master track "final" versions of cf-deployment
- Accepted a bunch of PRs:
  - Links:
    - Consul provides and consumes a link. No more static IPs!
    - Remove nats configuration from routing-release jobs and use links instead
  - Ops file for deploying local route emitter
  - Add cfdot job to diego cells

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Use doppler endpoint instead of constructing it from loggregator endpoint
- Bump version of networking plugin and use new networking command

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Add a meaningful error to etcd cluster check test

#### `nats-release`
- no changes

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- A bunch of small fixes based on feedback:
  - Use BBL_STATE_DIR and VARS_STORE_FILE variables consistently
  - Add `--debug` flag to `bbl` commands
  - Fixed a bug with trapped function calls

### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara
