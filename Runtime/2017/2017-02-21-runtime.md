## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per


### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Garden-runc 1.2 released with lots of nice new stuff - Highlights:
  - Docker Auth (requires an image_plugin that supports this, built in rootfs manager does not)
  - NetIn/Out moved to Create for c2c
  - RunC bumped to latest version
  - Inspector-garden is gone!!
  - iptables rules now have container guid in comment field!
- Ongoing: Rootless Garden work continues, `experimental_rootless` bosh flag allows opting in
  - can start up garden without root
  - progressing through allowing creating containers without root
- Upcoming:
  - Next release: CPU Maximums
  - Release after that: Better DNS (to support Bosh DNS use case etc), Performance Baseline with "Bucketbench tool"

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

### Greenhouse - A William Martin

- Inception on Windows Server 2016 Containers this past Friday. Will circulate results soon. Quick summary: Investigate OCI-compliant Garden/HCSSCIM layer. Risk: possible dependency on Docker for image layers.
- Aiming to promote `garden-windows-bosh-release` out of the incubator soon.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing with experimental work to store BBS and auctioneer locks in BBS DB instead of Consul
- Finishing initial work on providing instance-identity credentials in containers
- Route-emitter can connect to NATS via link
- Can opt into grootfs via manifest generation
- SSH-proxy can communicate to UAA via internal DNS
- Diego repositories enforce canonical code.cloudfoundry.org import path
- Upcoming:
  - Investigating strategies to migrate cell-presence registrations from consul to the BBS API/DB
  - Local route-emitters register TCP routes in addition to HTTP routes
  - Finish remaining BBS API commands for `cfdot`
