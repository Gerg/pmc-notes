## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.27.0 with plugin installation and management improvements as well as non-interactive docker image authentication on push. This release was built with Golang 1.8.3.
- Next planned release will have interactive docker image authentication on push, followed by exposing space scoped staging application security groups.
- After that, planning to expose org default isolation segments and various improvements to `cf login`.
- Cross-pairing with CAPI on v3 push. For now the commands are bare-bones and need to be revisited before publicly exposing them.
- This week, with most team members at the CF Summit, expecting little progress on the backlog.
