### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Highlights:
  - CPU Maximums Support
  - Rootless Containers! (Early Alpha)
  - MTU Defaulting
  - Performance Baseline (Much faster the docker, a little slower than raw runC)
- Next:
  - Continue/Complete Rootless Containers
  - BlockIO Limits
  - Performance Metrics

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

* Deployed GrootFS in 10% of PWS
* Explore options to make rootless GrootFS work with the Overlay-XFS driver
* Change configuration options to make the more consistent
* Support large numbers of layers in the Overlay-XFS driver.

### Greenhouse - A William Martin

- Continuing investigations into supporting Windows 2016 containers, rootfs, networking
- Succeeded in pushing the canonical `nora` app to a Windows 2016 container with Garden-HCS
- Will reach out to Garden to start scoping an OCI-compliant implementation

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Tasks and LRPs can run with Docker-image rootfses that require authentication
- The docker-app-lifecycle builder can stage Docker images that require authentication
- Investigating BBS performance degradation with 1000 locket-based cell registrations
- Cells can opt into using new v2 Loggregator API for app logs and container metrics
- Working on having cells support mutual TLS for asset uploads and downloads
- Continuing work on having the local route-emitters support TCP route registrations
- Upcoming:
  - Continuing with v2 Loggregator API support across Diego components
  - Improve locket performance and operability at 1000-cell scale
  - Rotate instance-identity credentials before end of validity
