## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per

### Garden - Julz Friedman

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

- CATS green
- Seeing performance problems streaming in to containers when the number of containers per cell grows above about 150 - problem seems to be related to BTRFS disk quotas
- Currently continuing to investigate and spiking on alternatives to BTRFS disk quotas

### Greenhouse - A William Martin

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished work to make local route-emitters operable at scale (and on Windows cells!)
- Investigated using gRPC for the BBS API, but don't yet see a compelling reason to switch it
- Converted remaining components to use config files instead of flags
- Investigated placement ramifications of removing auctioneer lock: exclusivity still important for optimal placement
- Added optional global start rate-limit to auctioneer to prevent catastrophic floods of instance-starts on constrained environments
- Started work to store BBS lock in BBS DB instead of consul
- Upcoming:
  - Investigating strategies to migrate cell-presence registrations from consul to the BBS API/DB
  - Making auctioneer deliberately back off of overloaded or failing cells
  - Finish remaining BBS API commands for `cfdot`


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`

#### `etcd-release`

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)

### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`
- Cut CF v251

#### `cf-deployment`
- Support for deploying windows cells
- Finalized integration with `bbl` so that deployers can easily bootstrap a director on GCP with bbl and then deploy cf-deployment
- Creating a [series of concourse tasks](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment-concourse-tasks) for spinning up new environments based on cf-deployment. Feel free to take a look and give the RelInt team your feedback.

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Moved concourse task for running CATs into [its own repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cats-concourse-task) so that release teams can easily run test their environments.

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- no changes

#### `nats-release`
- no changes

### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

#### `postgres-release`

- Working on acceptance tests

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel

### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor
- Deployed gRPC Metron<->Doppler in CF251 which secures log transport between metron and doppler (this was previously unsuccesful with TLS over TCP) 
- Added a gRPC endpoint inbound to metron
- Cleaned up our license notices
- Upcoming - we are adding app, org and space name to syslog drain 
- Upcoming we are working on new [scalable syslog architecture](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B31BWuPVGYIbQaEVfFhmTmp8_5t8RwGGHY_4q4unojI/edit#heading=h.qd5b0aiq5bbv)

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Nicholas Calugar

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj

### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran

### Bits-Service - Simon Moser

- integrated metrics in code 
- integrating metric collection in pipeline to measure for performance test (ongoing)
