## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per

### Garden - Julz Friedman

- RunC patched to address CVE-2016-9962 (garden mostly already safe due to existing defence-in-depth security layers, but CVE fix also worked around a kernel bug that resulted in a small window of vulnerability)
- Investigated and spiked out adopting some components from containerd
- Pid Cgroup support to limit number of processes in containers
- (Hopefully) finalised image plugin to enable grootfs, now noting latest compatible grootfs in release notes
- Single all-in-one "gdn" binary now available based on concourse/bin, makes it much easier to try out guardian
- Helped diego track down vizinni slowness (it was IOPS. It's always IOPS).
- Main focus now on rootless work
- Upcoming stories on some very frequently community requested features: cpu maximums, better handling of resolv.conf/DNS setup with 127.0.01, setting MTU based on host MTU

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

- CATS green
- Seeing performance problems streaming in to containers when the number of containers per cell grows above about 150 - problem seems to be related to BTRFS disk quotas
- Currently continuing to investigate and spiking on alternatives to BTRFS disk quotas

### Greenhouse - A William Martin

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished work to make local route-emitters operable at scale (and on Windows cells!)
- Investigated using gRPC for the BBS API, but don't yet see a compelling reason to switch it
- Converted remaining components to use config files instead of flags
- Investigated placement ramifications of removing auctioneer lock: exclusivity still important for optimal placement
- Added optional global start rate-limit to auctioneer to prevent catastrophic floods of instance-starts on constrained environments
- Started work to store BBS lock in BBS DB instead of consul
- Upcoming:
  - Investigating strategies to migrate cell-presence registrations from consul to the BBS API/DB
  - Making auctioneer deliberately back off of overloaded or failing cells
  - Finish remaining BBS API commands for `cfdot`


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`
- Adding configurable port for consul bind port for those who wish to run dnsMasq

#### `etcd-release`
- Windows client acceptance tests now pass and gate any new releases
- Working on running our unit tests for daemon on windows

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)
- Finished GCP support for bbl

- Documenting

### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`
- Cut CF v251

#### `cf-deployment`
- Support for deploying windows cells
- Finalized integration with `bbl` so that deployers can easily bootstrap a director on GCP with bbl and then deploy cf-deployment
- Creating a [series of concourse tasks](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment-concourse-tasks) for spinning up new environments based on cf-deployment. Feel free to take a look and give the RelInt team your feedback.

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Moved concourse task for running CATs into [its own repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cats-concourse-task) so that release teams can easily run test their environments.

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- no changes

#### `nats-release`
- no changes

### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

#### `postgres-release`

- Working on acceptance tests
