## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released an update to the Diego Enabler plugin to output a warning when migrating an app from DEA to Diego without routes (as the backend defaults to port health checking, a worker app may fail to start).
- Close to releasing cf CLI 6.24.0, which exposes the new http health check type to monitor a path on the app instances.  
  It also stops bundling the deprecated loggregator consumer library (see [announcement here](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/JISQUXZVSRQELIFWAJ7GIY2YSUWQLXE7/)), which means commands that connect to loggregator may fail on CF releases that do not expose the doppler endpoint.  
  The doppler endpoint was deemed stable since CF v203, so there should be no impact with any CF releases since.  
  We have taken advantage of this opportunity to remove code branches that cater for older CF releases, in particular CF releases before v196 (the time of split of domains into shared and private ones).
- The following release should follow soon after, introducing bash tab completion and addressing a few community reported issues.
- Space-scoped staging application group stories have been written, explored, pointed and scheduled for the release after.
- Isolation segment stories have been written and explored as well, leading to requests for CAPI to prepare additional V3 API endpoints so that the new commands and options to support this feature do not need to mix calls to V2 *and* V3 APIs.
- Investigated what `cf push` does, to break up its refactor into sizable chunks. The final stages of the `cf push` orchestration are basically `cf start` and `cf app`, so begun refactoring those.
  - Explored improvements to `cf push`'s resource matching and app upload processes, to reduce file I/O in order to resolve reported issues with slow upload speed as well as high CPU usage due to anti-virus software kicking in checking temporary files written to /tmp. Will spike on this when we get to the refactor of this part of `cf push` code.
- No progress on the proposal on JSON formatted output of CLI commands for easier scripting - still expecting to share it soon.
