## PMC Lifecycle Activities
Per discussion with Chip, it's enough to vote during the Runtime PMC meeting to move projects to active.
With Julian's update to last [PMC note](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/pmc-notes/blob/master/Runtime/2017/2017-02-21-runtime.md#persi---julian-hjortshoj) with specific repos to move to active, any objections?  If no objections, raised during the meeting, they will be promoted to active within the Runtime PMC and can be moved to the main cloudfoundry github org.
