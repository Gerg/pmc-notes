## PMC Lifecycle Activities

Per discussion with Chip, it's enough to vote during the Runtime PMC meeting to move projects to active.
With Julian's update to last [PMC note](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/pmc-notes/blob/master/Runtime/2017/2017-02-21-runtime.md#persi---julian-hjortshoj) with specific repos to move to active, any objections?  If no objections, raised during the meeting, they will be promoted to active within the Runtime PMC and can be moved to the main cloudfoundry github org.

- No objections raised during the meeting call.

## Discussion


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.25.0, with tab completion, memory and disk limits on tasks and a compiler flag change that resulted in 30% smaller binaries.
- Isolation segment release on track for release in a week or two.
- Exploring CLI UX for private docker registries. Also exploring assumptions around scripting with the cf CLI.

### Garden - Julz Friedman

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

* Implemented Docker support in the Overlay-XFS filesystem driver.
  - Removed the need for `xfs_quotas` when getting stats for an image.
* Added ops-file that works with cf-deployment.
* Several fixes and improvements in GrootFS to align behaviour with Garden expectations.
* Made GrootFS more robust by avoiding to let partially created images pollute the cache.
* Prepared a Datadog dashboard to closely monitor and assess the upcoming deployment in PWS.

### Greenhouse - A William Martin

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Cells can experimentally opt into registering themselves via the locket API
- Tightening up failover timing of BBS and auctioneer locks via "locket" service instead of Consul
- First pass at providing instance-identity credentials in containers done
- Cells remove executor cache size from auto-configured advertised capacity
- `cfdot` commands at parity with BBS API endpoints
- Route-emitters fail fast on startup if NATS client misconfigured
- Working on having the local route-emitters support TCP route registrations
- Working on having cells optionally support v2 Loggregator API to metron agent
- Upcoming:
  - Continuing with v2 Loggregator API support across Diego components
  - Validate locket performance at 1000-cell scale
  - Rotate instance-identity credentials before end of validity


### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Shipped routing-release 0.146.0, included in cf-release v253
  - There are now only two default ciphers
  - Smoke test added
  - Additional metrics for unregister messages and websockets
  - Bug fix to double-? issue
  - Debug servers listen on localhost by default
- Shipped routing-release 0.147.0
  - Retry when an idle keepalive connection is dropped when a container is destroyed
  - Relational database required for routing-api
  - Two-phase migration from etcd: first upgrade to v141-146 without migration, then deploy with config for relational db
  - Default for Gorouter `drain_wait` is now 20s (was 0)
- Final releases on Github now include auto-generated performance reports
- Migrating CI environments to GCP

### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`
* removed some reasons for us to vendor consul, more to follow

#### `etcd-release`
* process management script has reduced total time it waits for etcd cluster to avoid being reaped by monit
