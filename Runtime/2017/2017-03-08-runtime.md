## PMC Lifecycle Activities
Per discussion with Chip, it's enough to vote during the Runtime PMC meeting to move projects to active.
With Julian's update to last [PMC note](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/pmc-notes/blob/master/Runtime/2017/2017-02-21-runtime.md#persi---julian-hjortshoj) with specific repos to move to active, any objections?  If no objections, raised during the meeting, they will be promoted to active within the Runtime PMC and can be moved to the main cloudfoundry github org.

## Discussion


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.25.0, with tab completion, memory and disk limits on tasks and a compiler flag change that resulted in 30% smaller binaries.
- Isolation segment release on track for release in a week or two.
- Exploring CLI UX for private docker registries. Also exploring assumptions around scripting with the cf CLI.

### Garden - Julz Friedman

### GrootFS - George Lestaris

* Implemented Docker support in the Overlay-XFS filesystem driver.
  - Removed the need for `xfs_quotas` when getting stats for an image.
* Added ops-file that works with cf-deployment.
* Several fixes and improvements in GrootFS to align behaviour with Garden expectations.
* Made GrootFS more robust by avoiding to let partially created images pollute the cache.
* Prepared a Datadog dashboard to closely monitor and assess the upcoming deployment in PWS.

- First pass at providing instance-identity credentials in containers done
- Cells remove executor cache size from auto-configured advertised capacity
- `cfdot` commands at parity with BBS API endpoints
- Route-emitters fail fast on startup if NATS client misconfigured
