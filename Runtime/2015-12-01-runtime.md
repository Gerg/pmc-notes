## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Work continues on support in CC for users to specify ports Diego apps may listen on; this is a dependency for TCP Routing.
- Route Services work paused; CC contribution throughput limited to one pair. Will pick it up again once we finish the present TCP epic. CLI contribution paused until CLI PM returns from vacation.
- Work has begun on an epic to emit metrics consistently for all routing components, and expose them on Datadog dashboards. This sets the stage for our next performance benchmarking epic.

### MEGA - Amit Gupta

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell
 * Metron-Doppler link now running TCP/TLS traffic, now tuning buffering strategy with load testing
 * Loggregator as separate release underway (allows independent deployments to embed Metron and use to inject data into Loggregator)
 * Added metrics around requests in Traffic Controller
 * Added (missing) metrics for container metric sinks in Doppler

### UAA - Sree Tummidi
