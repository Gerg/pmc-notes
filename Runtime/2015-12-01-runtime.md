## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario
- Missing the meeting this week due to attending CF Summit Shanghai
- We've fixed the last of the DNS issues we were seeing in Windows Domain environments. Installing .NET support now adds localhost as the first DNS lookup so that we can find Consul as necessary, and moves all the existing DNS server entries down one notch.
- Made some improvements to our documentation, particularly as relating to our debugging tool, [Hakim](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/hakim).
- Completed set up of a new CI environment to keep us in sync with Diego's latest changes and ensure breaking changes in either direction do not go undetected.
- Added support for Metron TLS configuration.
- Forward: Continuing minor improvements to the current code (eg. debuggability, documentation, etc) and investigations for areas of improvement (eg. IIS native authentication, user certificates, etc)

### Diego - Eric Malm

### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Work continues on support in CC for users to specify ports Diego apps may listen on; this is a dependency for TCP Routing.
- Route Services work paused; CC contribution throughput limited to one pair. Will pick it up again once we finish the present TCP epic. CLI contribution paused until CLI PM returns from vacation.
- Work has begun on an epic to emit metrics consistently for all routing components, and expose them on Datadog dashboards. This sets the stage for our next performance benchmarking epic.

### MEGA - Amit Gupta

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell
 * Metron-Doppler link now running TCP/TLS traffic in development environments, now tuning buffering strategy with load testing. Release is on the horizon!
 * Loggregator as separate release underway (allows independent deployments to embed Metron and use to inject data into Loggregator)
 * Added metrics around requests in Traffic Controller
 * Added (missing) metrics for container metric sinks in Doppler

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### Lattice - David Wadden

### CAPI - Dieu Cao

### Flintstones - Simon Moser
