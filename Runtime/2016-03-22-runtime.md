## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Developing commands to Diego-Enabler plugin to ease bulk migration of apps between Diego and DEA runtimes.
- Investigating a string of recent regressions, many of which seem to stem from the move to Concourse and/or Golang 1.6. Created binary for issue submitters to check if it resolves the issues - waiting for response.
- Nearing completion of moving to doppler (using the noaa library) from using the deprecated loggregator endpoint.
- Reviewed TCP routing App Manifest proposal with Shannon, hope to share on CF Dev this week.
- One issue to resolve with the generated cf CLI command reference guide, hope to publish this week.
- Next CLI release will expose TCP routes and multiple app ports.
