## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Developing commands to Diego-Enabler plugin to ease bulk migration of apps between Diego and DEA runtimes.
- Investigating a string of recent regressions, many of which seem to stem from the move to Concourse and/or Golang 1.6. Created binary for issue submitters to check if it resolves the issues - waiting for response.
- Nearing completion of moving to doppler (using the noaa library) from using the deprecated loggregator endpoint.
- Reviewed TCP routing App Manifest proposal with Shannon, hope to share on CF Dev this week.
- One issue to resolve with the generated cf CLI command reference guide, hope to publish this week.
- Next CLI release will expose TCP routes and multiple app ports.

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Aiming to ship v0.335.0 this week. [Release notes will appear here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.335.0)

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Steady progress towards feature parity with Garden-Linux
- "All features required for production Cloud Foundry deployment" release marker a week or two out
- Next step: performance testing with large numbers of containers

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario
- Published a [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-windows-release/blob/master/docs/TROUBLESHOOT.md) for installing and debugging CF on Windows
- Fixed some small bugs
- Big story WIP: Enable running containerizer as SYSTEM account, which will reduce some of our requirements around user accounts
- More generally: continuing with chores and bugs as they come up

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished evaluation of cf-mysql for relational BBS DB
- Continuing to add MySQL DB support to BBS component
- Refinements to installation of trusted certs, rep drain script idempotence
- Improved BBS API docs on Tasks
- Upgrading to Go 1.6 in diego-release
- Working with CF Persistence team to add volume support to executor, BBS, auction
- Working with CAPI to move CC-Bridge into cf-release
- Will start work with Buildpacks team this week to extract Diego's cflinuxfs2 rootfs job into its own release
- Will start testing Guardian in Diego CI soon


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### MEGA - Amit Gupta

#### Infrastructure (Consul, etcd, NATS, Postgres)
* Small property changes to consul-release and etcd-release to decouple from CF
* Replaced spiff templating with simple, easily-modifiable, continuously integrated example manifests for etcd-release and consul-release
* Fixed bug in postgres shutdown script
* Increased community activity on etcd-release and consul-release; responded to several issues and PRs
* Investigated Consul WAN to support Elastic Clusters
* Lots of progress on "BOSH Bootloader", aka `bbl`, CLI tool to go from 0 to a BOSH ready to deploy 2.0-style deployments

#### Release Integration (cf-release, integration pipelines, acceptance tests, manifest generation)
* Cut v232, v233 of cf-release
* Incorporated Diego into main integration pipeline
* Lots of community stuff
* ELK running on main integration environment (A1 environment on AWS)
* Wrapping up work on redacting sensitive output from CATS and Smoke Tests
* Lots of work on manifest generation tooling, *but* pausing that to spike on BOSH 2.0 manifests

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel
- Fixed DEA drain again
- Starting apps can occur over HTTPS
- Actuals are sent to HM9K over HTTP soon HTTPS

### Bits-Service - Simon Moser
- implemented buildpack_cache endpoints in the bits service
- a few bug fixes for CI, logging, 
- incepted on next steps: v3 endpoints etc - see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HV6oPnWzQ2W5XitrJ2gaClzgoiw5B3ubJ8LKx_fZoUA/edit

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell

- Fixed bugs in both Doppler and Metron that had potential for runaway use of connections
- Added go pprof endpoints to all Loggregator components
- Proposal: add tags to metrics. This is designed to make metrics easier to consume.
 - For example, here is the current set of metric names that are used to emit memory consumption:
```
    router__0.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    auctioneer.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    cc_uploader.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    converger.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    file_server.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    nsync_bulker.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    nsync_listener.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    route_emitter.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    ssh-proxy.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    stager.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    tps_listener.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    tps_watcher.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    garden-linux.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    rep.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    DopplerServer.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    syslog_drain_binder.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    LoggregatorTrafficController.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    dea_logging_agent.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    etcd.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
    bbs.memoryStats.numBytesAllocated
```
 - Using tags, one possible presentation could be:

```	
numBytesAllocated
		type:vm_memory
		Component:router
		index:0
```
		
### UAA - Sree Tummidi
- 3.3.0 Release work in progress
 - Generic OpenID Connect Relying Party Support

### Container Networking - Evan Farrar

- Demonstrated connectivity between two guardian containers on different hosts!
- Working on deploying our guardian plugin work alongside Diego release
- Writing stories for DNS-based service discovery now so that we can show this working in some apps
- Robustness: closing some race conditions and responding properly to container lifecycle events
