### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- About to [release cf CLI v6.17.1](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117837557) that addresses a regression with app manifests with multiple apps, as well as securing-by-default access to the CF Community plugin repo, statically linked linux 64 bit binary, digitally signed Windows installers and CLI colors on Windows
  This release was planned for last week but due to red pipelines and Windows install path correction UX issues we ended up removing a release marker and work towards the next release marker.
- Next release will expose org quotas for reserved route ports (controlling the number of TCP routes)
- Worked with the Docs team on a new article on securing cf CLI communication to a CF deployment with [self-signed certificates](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/self-signed.html)
- Multiple app ports functionality temporarily hidden while Routing is reconsidering the APIs; [app manifest support for routes with paths and TCP routes](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/message/N4ZDS7FVHBQFSGP724ZAXUOMISNVURIR/) also on hold.
- Waiting for [community feedback](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/thread/KU4JNZ6HMNS62E6IFREG7NSUB6SFOISW/) on changing default health-check-type behaviour of `cf push` with Diego apps, after which we'll also expose 'process' as an alias to 'none' and document the related app manifest attribute.
