## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI v6.16.0 (exposing routing services, space-scoped service brokers, etc.) soon followed by v6.16.1 that fixed a regression in `cf sso-code`.
- Next release will expose TCP routes and multiple app ports.
- Completed the GoCD-> concourse migration.
- Struggling with deploying CF release and Diego and Routing on bosh-lite environments locally and on AWS. Looking forward to the day that they're included be default.
- Reserved cli.cloudfoundry.org domain with Chip, very close to publishing the online command reference guide.
- Internally shared a proposal for a better way to declare routes in app manifests. Rewriting to include two options based on feedback received so far.
- In looking into strategies to keep the language files up to date, trying to find the right contact person in IBM who may have experience with crowd-sourced translation (no progress).
- Working on a proposal for a cli command to check if it's the latest, potentially update itself (no progress).
