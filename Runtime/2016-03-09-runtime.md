## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI v6.16.0 (exposing routing services, space-scoped service brokers, etc.) soon followed by v6.16.1 that fixed a regression in `cf sso-code`.
- Next release will expose TCP routes and multiple app ports.
- Completed the GoCD-> concourse migration.
- Struggling with deploying CF release and Diego and Routing on bosh-lite environments locally and on AWS. Looking forward to the day that they're included be default.
- Reserved cli.cloudfoundry.org domain with Chip, very close to publishing the online command reference guide.
- Internally shared a proposal for a better way to declare routes in app manifests. Rewriting to include two options based on feedback received so far.
- In looking into strategies to keep the language files up to date, trying to find the right contact person in IBM who may have experience with crowd-sourced translation (no progress).
- Working on a proposal for a cli command to check if it's the latest, potentially update itself (no progress).


### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)


### Greenhouse - Steven Benario
- Lots of chores, fixing the build, etc in the past several weeks.
- Investigated a feature request from cf-dev about health checks being inconsistent on Windows. For now, we have decided not to implement any changes, as they would break existing behavior and we believe end up with a net-negative experience for users. Context: [#112914163](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1156164/stories/112914163)
- Fixed an issue in streaming in large droplets (or slow environments) to be consistent with diego on linux behavior.
- Continuing to move forward on incremental features and chores with a single pair.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing validation of relational store for BBS at scale
    - BBS benchmark test suite now generates realistic load on BBS, including rep's per-record operations
    - After some client-side HTTP tuning in the test suite, latest run at 200K instances is well within required bulk time windows
- Proceeding with relational store backend in BBS
- Incepted on scale work, import-path service, Diego operator tooling, investigating active rebalancing
- Removed DATs and Diego smoke tests in favor of CATs, CF Smoke Tests
- Re-did story to set up SSH server environment via launcher, but will roll back based on concern about idempotence of arbitrary buildpack .profile.d scripts
- Improving BBS API docs, starting with Tasks
- Cross-team pairing with Persi team to integrate volume management into executor
- Plan to work with Buildpacks team to extract Diego's cflinuxfs2 rootfs job into its own release
