# Runtime PMC Meeting 2016-01-25

## Agenda
* Announcements
* PMC Lifecycle Activities
* Backlog Review

## Announcements
- decision for CF final release candidate SHA now happens via issues in a [Foundation repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-final-release-election) and involves PMs and anchors from all teams contributing to the core.
- Amit proposes to make this repo publicly viewable (main risk is we need to be careful when discussing CVEs in relation to approving/disapproving a candidate SHA)
- Release notes have a section on Job Spec Changes; Amit is asking PMs to contribute to this section when they contribute to the rest of the release notes.
