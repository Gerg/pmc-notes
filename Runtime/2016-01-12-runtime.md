# Runtime PMC Meeting 2016-01-12

## Agenda
* PMC Lifecycle Activities
* Backlog Review

## PMC Lifecycle Activities

- Container Networking Team proposal for Incubation in the Runtime PMC
- Persistence Team proposal for Incubation in the Runtime PMC
- Separation of DEA, HM9K, and warden into a new team in the Runtime PMC.

## Backlog Reviews

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Fixed some bugs relating to use of custom registries as the defauly registry
- Turned on noatime and turned off journaling for the graph filesystem in an attempt to imrpove performance, though have not yet measured the impact due to CI pipeline issues
- Will ship v0.331.0 with the above changes once CI is back to normal

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Now running the Diego smoke tests against a CF deployment using Guardian!
- Next step is to use Vizzini (Diego tests) and DATS + CATS to confirm prioritisation of remaining work required to migrate Diego over to Guardian

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Bind-mounting buildpack downloads track done: BBS/executor story just delivered, needs final acceptance
- Running BBS benchmarks with more I/O performance on database VMs
	- are passing at 200K instances with bulk loop times around 25-30s
	- etcd raft term still increases quickly during test runs, probably when seeding records
- Investigated slow evacuation times during rolling deploys
	- native net-check action had negligible impact
	- system seems I/O-bound during creation of and copying droplet bits into dozens of containers
	- exploring broader distribution of in-flight container starts for mitigation
- `diego-sshd` server supports sftp subsystem (thanks to Matt Sykes!)
- Adding logging for CF app instance health transitions, will mute 'noisy' healthcheck logs
- Will merge DATs into CATs with appropriate BOSH configuration on errand to allow running correctly against either DEAs or Diego backends
- Various improvements to logging, metrics, and manifest generation


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### MEGA - Amit Gupta

#### Infrastructure (Consul, etcd, NATS, Postgres, environment bootstrapping)

#### Release Integration (cf-release, integration pipelines)

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell
 - **Major feature** [TLS Metron->Doppler](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/#enabling-tls-between-metron-and-doppler). Code released, next step is PWS deployment.
 - **Major feature** [Loggregator as a separate BOSH release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator/#loggregator-as-a-separate-release), deployable to non-CF deployments
 - Current work is performance analysis of Loggregator

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Dieu Cao
 - Continued work on Process Types and v3
 - Incepted on Monday on the [Tasks Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CCHDUa2UWRjXkxEdksX4M9BGQ8hBqiMys46wxeF5XE4/edit?usp=sharing)
 - Notes from the inception will be shared on cf-dev
 - Making progress on replacing nfs with webdav protocol as the default blobstore for cloud controller in cf-release
 - API work for support of Space Scoped Private Brokers is complete in cf-release 227.  Will be removing the experimental flags for it soon, hopefully in the next cf-release.
 - Will be syncing up with Dies of the CLI team around adding support for app instance limits and space scoped private brokers on Wednesday.
