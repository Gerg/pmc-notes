## PMC Lifecycle Activities

Proposal to move cfoundry to the cloudfoundy-attic
* It’s not being maintained.
* No objections raised during the PMC

## Current Backlog and Priorities

### Runtime
* nearly complete with Route API and context path routing
* Proposal to be sent out later this week for basic rate limiting for cloud controller to protect against users DOS’ing cloud controller
* Work planned soon to move to Concourse for CI
* Inception on Friday for rate limiting for CC and route services

### UAA	
* wrapping up LDAP multi-tenancy support
* starting on handling SAML attributes in tokens
* password policies is up after SAML support

### LAMB
* Discovered dopplers were more cpu/thread-bound than thought
  * Needed to unwind some goals until doppler efficiency improved.
  * Fix is in progress and going well.
* Up next #1 - Will bring back nozzles when pipeline can handle load	
* Up next #2 - Working with Runtime on etcd upgrade.

### Diego
* Completed 50-cell performance experiments and generated stories, will start 100-cell one soon
* SSH access to containers progressing, currently setting up app/space/system access policies in CC and external routability
* stories to come soon for versioning releases and schemas and improving inter-component security

### Greenhouse
* Tracking the Diego release well and hopes to have their first release coordinated with the first Diego release.
* Greenhouse team working with Century Link and HP to improve container isolation.
