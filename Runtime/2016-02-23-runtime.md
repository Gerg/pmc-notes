## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Team doubled to two pairs!
- Still close to releasing CLI v6.16.0, which will expose routing services, space-scoped service brokers, updated Japanese translations, various help page cleanups and a number of community requested features and bug fixes. We're waiting for the next cf release which contains a bug fix for one of the routing services APIs.
- Taking good advantage of the waiting for cf release time by completing the GoCD-> concourse migration and community bug fixing.
- Completing GoCD to Concourse migration. Intending to discard GoCD env right after CLI v6.16.0 is out.
- Pub Tools staged a draft of an integrate online command reference guide (`cf help` page only). Reviewing with them and working towards a separate site to hyperlink to for generated help from all commands and supported languages.
- In looking into strategies to keep the language files up to date, trying to find the right contact person with IBM who may have experience with crowd-sourced translation.
- Working on a proposal for a cli command to check if it's the latest, potentially update itself (no progress).

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Shipped v0.333.0, see the [release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.333.0) for details.
- Shipping v0.334.0 today, ([release notes here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release/releases/tag/v0.334.0)) with more configurable graph cleanup options. Previously just on/off, now a disk usage threshold can be set.
- Fixed a bug that was affecting BOSH-Lite where containers sometimes temporarily lost network connectivity when other containers were created or destroyed.

#### Guardian (OCS/runC)

- Docker lifecle tests now pass in DATS. SSH suite failing - turns out we weren't previously running it because the tests exited after the Docker failures. Hope to see it all green this week.
- Will chat to Diego team in the next week to begin forming an integration and switchover plan.

### Greenhouse - Steven Benario
- A number of chores and bug fixes, including validating and accepting some pull requests
- Fixed a broken build several times
- Created API proposal for Garden port mapping to work cross-platform
- Moving forward continuing with bug fixes, chores, and seeking feedback from real world users


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing validation of relational store for BBS at scale
	- improved BBS benchmark suite to include individual read/write load from cell reps
	- benchmarking against CF MySQL deployment, investigating its failure modes
- In-memory cache in BBS improved retrieval times, but would still entail storing GBs of data in etcd
- Can install trusted certs in cflinuxfs2 containers, working on providing to all Linux containers
- Documented and published team tooling to create a CF+Diego deployment on AWS
- Added logging, metrics to determine whether the route-emitter's routing table ever maps two instances to the same ip:port
- Fixing bugs around handling special characters in credentials


### Routing - Shannon Coen

### MEGA - Amit Gupta

#### Infrastructure (Consul, etcd, NATS, Postgres, environment bootstrapping)

#### Release Integration (cf-release, integration pipelines)

### Runtime OG - Michael Fraenkel

### Loggregator - Jim Campbell

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Dieu Cao

### PERSI - Ted Young
- Created Bosh Release for CephFS
- Research, CI and team bootstrapping almost complete. It takes about a month for a team to get set up and oriented.
- Gravitating towards Docker Plugin model
- Getting validation of our approach from customers
  - Scratch space is a useful offering in tandem with DFS
  - How to offer existing datasets as services/plans is an area to explore

### Container Networking - Evan Farrar
