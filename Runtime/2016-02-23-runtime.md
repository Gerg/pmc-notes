## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Team doubled to two pairs!
- Still close to releasing CLI v6.16.0, which will expose routing services, space-scoped service brokers, updated Japanese translations, various help page cleanups and a number of community requested features and bug fixes. We're waiting for the next cf release which contains a bug fix for one of the routing services APIs.
- Taking good advantage of the waiting for cf release time by completing the GoCD-> concourse migration and community bug fixing.
- Completing GoCD to Concourse migration. Intending to discard GoCD env right after CLI v6.16.0 is out.
- Pub Tools staged a draft of an integrate online command reference guide (`cf help` page only). Reviewing with them and working towards a separate site to hyperlink to for generated help from all commands and supported languages.
- In looking into strategies to keep the language files up to date, trying to find the right contact person with IBM who may have experience with crowd-sourced translation.
- Working on a proposal for a cli command to check if it's the latest, potentially update itself (no progress).
