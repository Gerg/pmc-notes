## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Squeezing in a minor release addressing some regressions (plug-ins, .cfignore pattern, loggregator panic) and allowing binding of route services to routes with paths, after which we'll continue on adding support for defining TCP routes and HTTP routes with paths in app manifests
- Completed phase 1 of improving `cf help` UX, added to the backlog after the above mentioned releases. The idea is that `cf help` output would be reduced in length by omitting admin-only and less frequently used commands, command descriptions, and the remaining commands will be listed in tabular format to take advantage of window width (like `ls`). `cf help -a` will return the current output. We'll also add a `SEE ALSO` section to the help of subcommands.
