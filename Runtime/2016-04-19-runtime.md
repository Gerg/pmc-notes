## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI v6.17.0 (exposing TCP routes, app instance quotas, Golang 1.6.1 built, etc.)
- Patch release planned to address a regression with app manifests with multiple apps, as well as securing-by-default access to the CF Community plugin repo
- Multiple app ports functionality temporarily hidden while Routing is reconsidering the APIs
- Reviewing TCP route quota stories according to latest API spec
- Investigating API timeouts: considering whether to exposure a configurable timeout or rely on platform settings

### Garden - Will Pragnell

#### Garden-Linux

- Shipped v0.337.0 using Go 1.6.1

#### Garden-runC

- Renamed Guardian to Garden-runC after receiving feedback that people were confused about the difference between Garden and Guardian
- We believe we are now feature complete for Cloud Foundry use - will ship a new release as soon as we fix a goroutine leak
- Initial results of running our performance tests very promising - container creation looks like it takes about 60% of the time it took using Garden-Linux on the same hardware
- Handful of stories still to do to to get Concourse off of Garden-Linux and on to Garden-runC
