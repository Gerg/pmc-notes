## Attendees


## Update on CI tools (Mike Dalessio)

- Krafa track of work has been broadly defined, and it's in the
  Toolsmiths [public backlog and icebox][toolsmiths-tracker].

- A pair is continuing work on License Finder, which is an OSS tool to
  examine a project's declared dependencies (via a package manager)
  and discover licenses and changes in licensing. This should be
  useful for the Foundation as well.


## Update on CLI (Greg Oehman)


## Update on Eclipse plugin and Java tools (Ryan Morgan)

* Eclipse tooling 1.8.3 release (Nieraj posted notes about this to cf-dev).
