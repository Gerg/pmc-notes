## Update on CI tools (Mike Dalessio)

- Krafa track of work has been broadly defined, and it's in the
  Toolsmiths [public backlog and icebox][toolsmiths-tracker].

- A pair is continuing work on [License Finder][lf], which is an OSS tool to
  examine a project's declared dependencies (via a package manager)
  and discover licenses and changes in licensing. This should be
  useful for the Foundation as well. (See [Tracker here][lf-tracker].)


## Update on CLI (Greg Oehman)

The CLI team released version 6.12.1 on 7/6/2015.  Release notes,
download instructions and binaries are available at
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases


## Update on Eclipse plugin and Java tools (Ryan Morgan)

* Eclipse tooling 1.8.3 release (Nieraj posted notes about this to cf-dev).


## Proposal to accept receptor-client into incubation

Last meeting, Ryan Morgan [proposed receptor-client for acceptance][receptor-client-proposal] into incubation.



No objections having been raised, on either the mailing list or in the
PMC meeting, this is now accepted into incubation.


## Open Discussion

None.
