## Incubating HP projects: Next steps

Several repositories are being incubated as of CF Summit under the
umbrella of two projects:

* [Visual Studio plugin][vsp] and [MSBuild tasks][msbuild]
* [.NET SDK][sdk]

(similar to how we have the Java Tools and Eclipse Plugin projects today).

The Foundation would like to set up a public Pivotal Tracker project
for these projects, and enable working via distributed committer model
for the time being.

  [vsp]: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-vs-extension
  [msbuild]: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-msbuild-tasks
  [sdk]: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/cf-dotnet-sdk
