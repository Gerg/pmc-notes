## CLI

Due to Thanksgiving, CF Summit, vacations and illness, the CLI team had only one developer for most of the month.
Taking advantage of the PM's absence during his vacation, the team caught up on chores for 2-3 weeks straight. The main purpose of this work was cleaning up code in preparation for onboarding new developers.


### Releases

Despite the reduction in team strength, CLI v6.14.0 was released completing the Organization and Space RBAC epic,
and CLI v6.14.1 is about to be released with improved installer UX and various bug fixes, mostly to community reported issues.


### Ongoing / Upcoming work

* Started reviewing CLI UX for new Routing features, reviewing PRs from Routing team.
* Started design discussion for stories upcoming around [CC v3 API](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/2088038).


### Team developments

* One CLI developer is visiting Sydney in January 2016 to help rapidly onboard a Sydney based Fujitsu engineer to the CLI team.
* Continued reduced team strength due to the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
