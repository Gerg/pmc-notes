2. Update on CLI (Greg Oehman)
3. Update on Eclipse plugin and Java tools (Ryan Morgan)
4. Open Discussion


## Attendees

* Chip Childers, Cloud Foundry Foundation
* Mike Dalessio, Pivotal (PMC lead)
* Christopher Ferriss, IBM
* Michael Fraenkel, IBM
* James Bayer, Pivotal
* Greg Oehmen, Pivotal

## Update on CI tools (Mike Dalessio)

[GoCD][gocd] still in use for some projects, but thereâ€™s movement
towards [Concourse][concourse] and teams are enthusiastic about
it. Currently Diego, Garden, BOSH-lite, Loggregator, and CLI have
converted to Concourse; and BOSH, Services API, and Buildpacks are in
progress.

Timeline is open for individual teams to move to Concourse; some teams
may decide not to. Having a heterogenous CI environment is OK, as both
GoCD and Concourse can integrate via S3 buckets, which is where
generated artifacts are generally kept.


## Update on CLI (Greg Oehmen)

* Released 6.11.0 - 4/17
* Released 6.11.1 - 4/20
* Released 6.11.2 - 4/28

Big uptick in issues/PRs

Plugin API feature

Look Ahead:

1. help refactor work, 
  - refactor help
  - invert syntax (object - action)
  - tab/bash completion

2. support the move to cc API 3.0 and services api changes

3. the user security work (pwd expiration, inactivity-based session timeout, RBAC maturation, etc.) 

4. installer emphasis
  - Auto-update within CLI
  - signed mac installer
  - signed windows installer
  - etc

5. APM integration - something like blessed-contrib:  https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib
