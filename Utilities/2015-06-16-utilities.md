## Update on CI tools (Mike Dalessio)

- Greenhouse team started moving their builds to Concourse. Runtime
  and BOSH are also in progress.

- Toolsmiths team taking over Krafa, which is a project (to-be-OSSed)
  to manage a pool of CI environments. Currently being used internally
  at Pivotal, but totally applicable to OSS as well.

- A pair is working for the next month on License Finder, which is an
  OSS tool to examine a project's declared dependencies (via a package
  manager) and discover licenses and changes in licensing. This should
  be useful for the Foundation as well.
