# Services PMC Meeting 2015-08-11

## PMC Lifecycle Activities
- [cf-mysql-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release) and [cf-riak-cs-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-riak-cs-release) BOSH releases officially part of the Services PMC. Should have been done a while ago. These are not incubating projects but mature releases expected to be used by Cloud Foundry itself.
- We've stopped meeting in person bi-weekly; no one attended and we were plagued by Webex issues. We'll send out an email bi-weekly to cf-dev as a roll-up of PMC and project news.
