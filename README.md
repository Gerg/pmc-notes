# PMC Notes

This repository contains agendas and notes for all Project Management
Committee ("PMC") meetings, as described in the
[Development Governance Policy][governance-policy].

PMC membership can be seen [here][pmc-membership].


## Conventions

Each meeting's agenda and notes are in a separate markdown file, named
in a way to indicate the date of the meeting and the name of the PMC.

It's highly recommended to name the file so that it begins with the
[ISO 8601][iso-8601] date format (e.g. `2015-05-05`).

A good example would be `Buildpacks/2015-05-04-buildpacks.md`
